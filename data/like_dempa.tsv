140006	They care about this country, citizens and democracy
140012	They care more about people than money

140017	Position on women rights, improving health care in the country (accessibility)
140018	looking out for all Americans. not greedy and trying to just cater to the rich
140019	They would do a better job of governing and compromising with the other party to get things done.
140023	While their policies are not all productive or something I agree with, they check off more boxes and if we only have two choices, they are clearly the better one.
140026	SK
140033	freedom of choice, reverence for scientific institutions, social equality, rights of citizens over big corporations, social justice, willingness to implement pro climate policies
140035	support of individual liberties
140037	THEY CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE'S INSTEAD OF THEIR POCKETS BEING FILED UP.
140038	Will let me cling on to some rights that I enjoy like womens equal rights, LGBTQ+ rights. Maybe gun control. Maybe nationalized health care. These are possibilities.
140039	support for a woman's right to choose, for a social safety net, for freedom of choice in reading materials, for gay rights, for transgender care, for universal health care - to start with

140050	I think the Democratic Party attempts to find ways that positively impact all facets of our society, not just the wealthy or powerful.
140052	What I like about the Democrats is because they seem to put the well-being of the country and the people of the United States above adherence to party or individual people. Democrats, while not perfect, tend toward serving the greatest good for the average American.

140060	for the most part the democrats align with my views. help for all, low taxes, no stringent immigration laws, pro choice that kind of thing
140061	it isn't about the party as a whole and it is on one specific issue, and terrible important one to me, the killing of 40,000 Palestiniens. I think Biden's support of Netanyahu was shocking. I find it equally shocking that we vote in the United Nations the way we do with respect to the Middle East. We like to think that we are leaders of the world. In this issue, we lead" 1/2 doz people and are opposed by almost all nations in the world."
140062	They sometimes introduce legislation and vote in ways to help the American people. They also take lobbying money but in general, they seem to care more about the people.

140139	I have been a Democrat my hole life I believe that they are for the people and not what they can gain for themselves.
140142	The democratic party wants and are helping time America people. To me they are doing their best to go against the republican party by helping the low and middle class families. Working on pollution too help ease the global warming that is really destroying our earth.

The Democratic party eschews anyone taking away the rights of others to participate in the democratic process and abhors the possibility of autocratic rule. They also believe in being a role model for democratic values for the rest of the world and supports other democratic nations to fight against potential autocracy."
142016	Generally more in line with my views. Seem more positive.
142019	They seem to be corrupt and not in touch with the peoples needs.
142020	liberal policies, stance on abortion, immigration

142050	Social policies, pro choice, desire to increase taxes on the rich.
142053	Stand with my values. They are for the people and are trying to help the middle class
142059	I like that the party thinks about historically disadvantaged people. I like that they are more progressive in their positions. I like that they care about women's health rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and the systemic racism that people of color face.
142061	I like that the majority of Democrats I’ve heard speak seem still willing to listen to reason regarding policy.
142062	They’re more accepting
142065	BECAUSE WE PROTECT AMERICANS RIGHTS
142067	The Party is always working for the People of the Unites States of America.
142068	they seem to actually care about human rights and the environment, among many other things that align more with my beliefs
142069	They are a normal party with both good and no so good players.
142072	They want to preserve our democracy and restore our rights and freedoms
142074	?..mmm mm……..

142099	They are all for the people and what is best for the country and the world. They believe in democracy and the rule of law.
142100	law and order constitutional rights freedom of choice
142104	Joe Biden, Kamala Harris , Roy cooper , Tim Walz. believe in womens right to choose . not racist,
142105	I feel the Democratic Party practices more inclusiveness
142107	I think there are good people in the party. Unfortunately they have been ignored and marginalized by the radicals, who are willing to do violence to silence their opponents. Democrats used to stand for fairness, free speech, civililty, and taking care of people. They can get back there again if their silent majority would speak up.
142109	everything they stand for
142110	It's inclusive. Its policies make sense and will make the lives of the lower and middle class better.
142113	there tax plan.
142114	They are for Human Rights First
142120	innovative, forward thinking, big tent, new ideas, fair, welcoming or accepting of all people…
142121	They actually have proactive stances about issues, even if I don't necessarily agree with all of them.

142125	Health care plans for underprivilege.

142132	SK
142134	They operate as a team and not as 1 individual running the party
142136	most
142138	They seem to be the principled party at this point, their stances or abortion rights, on immigration, education, and social services I agree with. When they take it too far left then we have a problem.
142139	Their commitment to civil rights, equality and equity.
142141	That they are for helping the poor.
142142	they are cohesive
142146	Pro choice, women's rights, civil rights. Believe in Democracy and the right to vote.
142148	They care about everyone listening to what they say
142152	abortion policies
142155	the D party is mostly behind the average American. They are however, road blocked by the MAGAs & some Ds (Manchin). [CHAR(10)]Ds want to take action against climate change, increase Medicare, social security, eliminate student debt, infrastructure, ‘bringing back jobs to the USA, make the rich pay their fair share of taxes…
142162	Standing up for a women's right to choose what happens to her body. This is a personal decision and the government should stay the hell of out it.
142163	They still want democracy
142164	They are for all people. You don't have to be rich to get help from them. The economy is always better under the democratic party. They put country above party.
142165	healthcare expansion, equality
142169	Under Biden and it seems like Kamala, I like that they've gotten more progressive on economic policy. The Inflation Reduction Act and Build Back Better seem to be legitimate wins policy-wise that help average Americans. Naturally, I wish they were more progressive. I wish we had universal healthcare, higher marginal taxes, free college, etc. but the Democratic party seems more progressive than under Obama. I also appreciate that by forcing Biden out of running for office again and picking Kamala/Walz it seems like the Democrats are actually trying to win.
142172	Women's Rights
142175	They are organized in attacking their opponents. They know that it is a WAR of ideas and they get people, mostly pieces of shit people, out to spread their propaganda to make it appear to be truth while the Republicans are just sitting home hoping for the best.
142176	They seem to be more concerned about people & their well-being.
142182	At one point in my life I was a democrat.
142187	not overrun with Christian nationalism
142190	concerned about what is best for America
142191	Moderation, rather than forcing the opposite just to be extreme
142193	They generally have some decent ideas that radiate with my thinking.
142194	inclusivity of approaches
142195	While democrats favor non-therapeutic abortion, a major failing in my opinion, most other policies they espouse are more realistic the those of the GOP. However, the nation is so evenly divided that it's difficult for Democratic policies to get through Congress. Especially the Senate thanks to the asinine filibuster rules. While the filibuster used to be a credible means for a minority to have influence, the present rules mean that a super majority is required to pass any law that the GOP opposes. Which comprises about any law that the Democrats put forward. Congress is all but deadlocked in a GOP quagmire.
142196	woman’s rights ,, [CHAR(10)]help the helpless
142201	They remind me of what Al Pacino calls hoo-ha" in one of his movies."
142206	only way to go
142207	 compassion for people
142210	They are Socialists and don't love America. They have left the fundamental beliefs that[CHAR(10)]started our country. Belief in God, Christian values, the Bible truths, that faith our early[CHAR(10)]fathers had like Lincoln & Washington. They don't respect our police and that is so sad.[CHAR(10)]They have an evil agenda.
142211	Talk Talk Talk ... just keep circling" their wagons"
142213	the opposite of the republicans views on women’s rights and the LGBTQ rights. climate change views. some economic policies.
142214	they include all peoplw.
142218	fighting for people however not much getting done, lots of talking not much in rral life ...
142219	The Democratic Party stands for the advancement of all people including policies, cost of living and laws. For all people, not just the people with income or investments over $100,000.
142220	For the most part I think Biden has done and awesome job dealing with Covid pandemic. He's gotten us out of the pandemic. I think all the anti-vaccine people are contributing to COVID still which is now called endemic". Biden also has had to deal with Ukraine and Israel, and inflation. "
142223	I do appreciate some of their environmental policies but often when these things get passed it is just a facade. Most policies are poorly written and include shady add ons.
142224	there support for the working class
142225	The looser stance on abortion.
142228	Their stance that everyone should have equal rights and choice. Their desire to push forward innovation and support the growth of the nation.
142229	inclusivity[CHAR(10)]Contrary to traditional painting the Democratic Party as one of identity politics, it seems to me that the Trump-owned GOP directs its fears and retribution to exploit the so-called un-elite, disenfranchised" of our society, characterizing them as victims of our government. The DEMs identity politics is more one of inclusivity of our ethnic, racial and cultural diversity than that of the GOP."
142231	They support abortions

142233	I like the intent behind some of their policies, that they try to look out for everyone. For example, universal healthcare—I like that the intent is to provide basic healthcare needs to everyone—even if I don’t agree with the implementation of the policy.
142239	They are, like all politicians, corrupt in many ways. However, they are currently acting in more ways to try to restore and protect personal freedoms in ways that are more in tune and in line with Constitutional and true moral values.
142240	Support of right to choose, concern over the environment, limitation of firearms
142246	Total restauración de la confianza internacional y Solidaridad de nuestros aliados internacionales perdidas será te la presidencia de Donald Trump.
142248	Democratic Party espouses keeping the government out of women’s health issues. The Party is more concerned with helping the middle and lower classes with housing and health issues. I think Democrats are much more likely to defend the people’s rights than the Republicans.
142249	they want work for the ordinary working American
142251	they seem to be trying to help seniors
142254	raising taxes and not stopping inflation. not a strong supporter of military
142258	They allow legal immigration.
142259	Despite the rise of what I believe is an equally dangerous element of illiberalism within the party to that of the far right in this country (specifically, the Progressive wing), the Democratic Party points itself towards what is good for the country. They try to solve problems, generally, that are facing everyday Americans. By and large, they provide a vision to make things better and work to implement that vision.
142261	Truth - the democrats have a platform that looks after people.
142262	thier stance on rights for all - lgbtq, women, POCs etc.
142267	health policies
142269	at this point in time they appear to have there sights set to to work on as a hole betterment to our society.and a common decency to men an women an to all with different ways people live there lives.
142270	I believe that Democrats believe the economy should benefit everyone, health care is a right, our diversity is our strength, and democracy is worth defending. Everyone deserves the opportunity to live and thrive.
142271	Policies and values mostly align with mine.
142272	foreign policy where inclusion is strength. looking out for the helpless.
142275	Stance on abortion, keeping immigrant's families together
142279	The DNC is about people and country.
142281	The Democratic party is for the people![CHAR(10)]
142283	In general, the focus is on the community and people. The party can be messy around these decisions because of the politics or the issues of individual politicians. But, overall the focus is on the people. On reproductive rights for women, rights for LGBTQIA, rights for marginalized populations, connection with other countries and cultures, etc. I wish they were louder as a party on gun rights, but this still is a contentious issue. An additional focus is economic stability vs CEO wealth. Generally, public health and individual wellness is a focus nationally ;-)
142284	they have a vision for the future and their agenda is good for America
142288	SK
142289	foreign policy
142292	they stand up for women’s rights, human rights, lgbt equality, equal pay, childcare costs, healthcare
142294	they look out for middle class and poor people

142296	ideally they work to create programs to help people and continuous improvement of those programs. Welcoming of people all colors and orientations. Favors programs that protect the environment and increase regulations on the wrong-doings of business. But, the party is constantly changing and it takes researching a candidate despite their party affiliation to know where someone stands.
142297	They want to tax rich people
142299	its candidates share my values.
142301	They are available to talk to and they favor social programs.

142323	They do not seem to name call and act immature berating people. They appear to want to work on the country's issues. I really wish I did not have to choose by party, but rather by person.
142326	They tend to do more for the needy.
142327	women's rights, gun control, health care, immigration
142329	The Democratic Party supports the middle class and the poor. They have a social conscience. The Democrats support women's rights. They are tolerant and inclusive.

142347	Nominally progressive. I would still prefer a more left-wing option.
142349	They are for the people. They're fair-minded, want to get things done, positive thinking, forward moving and they smile.
142352	Seem to care a bit more about middle class and helping everyone succeed.

142380	protection of reproductive rights, support of public education
142381	the DNC's ability to get the media on their side to repeat talking points to sway public opinion. ot would be admirable if it wasnt so terrifying for our country
142388	On nearly every policy and social issue, the mainstream Democratic Party position is identical to my personal position. Zionism/pro-Israel foreign policy, social policy spending, health care access, support for Ukraine and Taiwan, support for international institutions that preserve peace such as NATO, need to act on climate change, need to improve industrial base so we are not dependent on China for crucial materials like semiconductors, need to fund infrastructure and public schools, need to provide free community college.
142391	The democrats are the champions of the U.S. Constitution and democracy , defenders of civil rights and freedom .

142441	Stances on student loan forgiveness, abortion, LGBT issues, public schools,
142443	I feel that Biden is a well-meaning man and did a great job for this country given the many, many Republican obstacles. I applaud him for stepping down, even though he was actually thrown out, but he has health issues and I believe, neurological disorders, which prove it very difficult for him to carry on with any job let alone the presidency. AG Garland is very weak and certainly could have done more to speak up for Biden - especially when it came to all of the top secret files that Trump had at Mar-a-Lago. Biden certainly helped turn things around regarding Covid getting the medication out and ringing the end to everyone being in lockdown. He did as much as he could with the border and did a great job in securing our friendship with our allies around the world.
142444	Seem to be more sensible
142445	The ability to keep democracy
142448	healthcare reform, fixing student debt crisis
142449	human rights (women, minorities, LGBTQIA+)
142451	They seem more inclusive of people. They also seem more willing to work with others across the aisle.
142452	I like their heart, and their concern about trying to take care of the most needy individuals.
142454	I agree with the majority of its policies. I used to be a diehard Republican who Never thought of voting for the democratic ticket but the GOP’s MAGA faction is a dangerous cult and one i will never be a part of.
142455	they’re represented by a donkey. donkeys are nice, but they kick sometimes.
142456	There has not been the controversy around the Democratic party as there was and is with the Trump circus. From Clinton to Obama to Biden, these Presidents have worked to make our country better and not divided like the GOP. They have tried to pass policy that will do things for Americans. Biden was able to forgive student debt for tens of thousands of students that helps them get a foot up in this world.
142458	they seem to be more reasonable, and don’t seem to subscribe to conspiracy theories
142460	they are progressive and want rights for all people

142466	They dont play politics as hard they cross the lines to work with everyone and they remain dignified and professional while dolts shout and mock like undisciplined children.
142472	I’ve always agreed with their policies on assisting families in need and helping others that are less fortunate.
142473	This party is more inclusive and has respect for people. They support taking some measures to reform gun control, they support a healthier, more true vision of access to education, they support a woman's right to make choices about her own body and understand abortion is part of healthcare. The economy has been better and crime has gone down since winning back the White House in 2020.
142479	tHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS MORE PEOPLE ORIENTED
142483	womens reproductive rights
142486	They lie! They always have a hidden agenda that is positive for them but not so much the American people.

142519	most are for the rights of the public common man
142523	I like that they are looking at the middle class' and those in poverty and working hard for these people. I think that the tax system favors corporate entities and billionaires. I think the democratic party has a better understanding of the American family's needs than the Republican Party.

142559	They Actually Solve Prolems
142560	I feel they push people against each other. Not enough punishment for crimes, border control, etc.
142561	Democrats have consistently defended the rights of African Americans and women. They have enacted health care reform to make insurance more affordable. They support a woman's right to make her own choices about abortion (perhaps in consultation with her partner, doctor, or spiritual counselor). They are more likely to enact anti-trust measures and regulate businesses for environmental and work related violations. They respect the freedom of religion. They support equal rights for LGBT+ and they support same sex marriage. They will stand strong against Putin and Russia and support Ukraine's fight to defend themselves from Russian invasion. Democrats support environmental regulations and believe in climate change. Democrats are more likely to support unions and to support adequate funding for K-12 education, and for two and four year colleges. They are also more likely to support basic science resesrch that will keep us competitive with other countries around the world.

142582	 I believe they look out for middle class and help with building the economy from bottom up.
142585	Their social policies are more in alignment with my stance. I believe fiercely in free speech, gun reform, and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. They also have more decorum than the Republican party these days.
142586	They have cause our Country great difficulty, opened the borders for illegals, and they use our money to pay for all this nonsense.

210387	I appreciate the Democratic Party's prioritization of providing a baseline level of care and human individual rights/support while leaving room for individual decision-making in the context of their own life. For example, in terms of abortion access, by allowing access to abortions, it gives the individual the CHOICE on whether or not they want/need to undergo that procedure-- it places the decision making in the hands of the individual and not that of the government (i.e. if restricted, individuals would not even have that choice). I believe that the Democratic Party focuses on protecting the existence of options for an individual while providing baseline support (such as social security, healthcare programs, etc.) that allows for growth despite economic limitations. Essentially, I support the humanistic (as opposed to economic) approach of the Democratic Party.
