140762	conservative, thoughtful
140767	I think they do more for our country and economy and protect our borders
140773	They give away the farm like Democates do
140774	Less government, less give away, more state control
140775	I like the idea of strong defense, tough on crime and small government. I think that is more in line with the republican party.

140854	They largely represent my values including low taxes and the value of innovation where everyone has a shot at achieving the American dream.
140857	I think all politicians from both parties are in it for themselves, but it just seems like the Republicans are more concerned with trying to balance the budget, not waste money as much and they care more about the American people
140865	Stance on immigration

140900	They have values and morals...they are imperfect but my preference

140952	They seem to be in touch with how I feel most Americans think and offer solutions that are best for the collective citizenry - we get the most 'wins' with the fewest 'losses'. Philosophically, I believe we, the government, should help people help themselves and the Republican party tends (only tends) to do that better than the current Democratic party (not the doctrine, but the implementation plan).
140954	all things
140956	more for working class, middle class interests

141018	Want to bring back oil production, tighten up borders, protect the lives of unborn children, support traditional family values,

141023	economic policies
141024	They appear to want less government oversight in people’s lives any funnel more to the states
141026	They have some good ideas. The immigration should be controlled as too many drugs are coming into the country. There is still quite a bit of negativity with both parties.
141027	they are conservative and against open borders. they are against men competing with women.
141028	they seem to get more done to help America while Democrats spend time supporting other countries

141038	More conservative
141040	Seguridad Nacional
141041	strongly right direction
141043	The Republican party has a different ideology on foreign affairs than the Democratic Party. However, it does not always consider all Americans when it comes to fairness like taxes or meeting us where we are like education or housing.
141045	freedom. less big government
141051	I like there is still room for individual to express their own view and not be a party of one thought like the democrats
141053	Their family values and appreciation for religion.
141056	they seem to care more about traditional, American values and ones that I believe make for a strong, independent nation of strength, integrity, security, and prosperity, and Republicans seem to believe in God as do I

141075	Republican's Have Morals and are The Better Choice for the United States for Now...
141077	I had hoped that they would be the ones to cut spending. We can't afford to be spending all this money on unnecessary programs when we don't have it and the economy is struggling. But alas, I feel like they will not be able to do it with the political animosity surrounding Washington.
141078	Their views on abortion
141079	The American dream “pick your self up for by your own boot straps” motto and the policies surrounding abortion
141080	The idea of efficiency in government and fiscal responsibility appeals to me.
141081	I like that they showed a different side to republicans on Scandal. I was able to understand that they also fight for equality but only for the richest people.
141083	I like the Republican Party because they respect the law, and the Democratic Party continually disrespects the rights of Americans. Allowing millions of illegal immigrants into the US is a slap in the face of US citizens and our legal immigrants.
141084	certain ideas on topics
141085	They are more conservative than the other party.
141086	tax cuts for middle class
141088	Donald Trump's Policies. He can do a lot for our country to make it better. I truly believe in him!

141131	Donald Trump and JD Vance, along with several Senators and House members
141132	A strong immigration policy, stronger on crime, leaving abortion to the states, a stronger defense, a stronger foreign policy dealing with countries like Iran, Russia and China.
141138	They are for the people instead of out for power in most cases. we need smaller government and more control over our own lives. we need God back in the public square. they believe in these things. protect our borders!!!!!!
141139	I like that they support lower taxes and gun rights.
141140	certain foreign policies, trade, etc
141141	conservative not too far left
141142	The things they believe in the values in the morals
141144	Particularly, that they would select Trump to represent them. Otherwise, they're just as bad as Democrats, not listening to the other side.
141147	More fiscally conservative.
141150	Fiscal responsability
141152	For the few remaining moderates, bi-partisan attempts at balanced fiscal responsibility. For most everyone else in MAGA land, nothing is good.
141154	their intent to regulate the immigration and border control
141155	they are for the people
141157	Border security, building up and maintaining the U S military and defense along with new development of things militarily the country will probably need like the space force. I think they will allow the development of new forms of medications then the Democrats will and maybe also energy development.
141158	I feel that the Republican Party, as it used to be, served a purpose in American Politics. It provided a balance to the ideas of the Democratics, who largely searched for governmental solutions to inequity. In contrast, the Republicans would search for ways to solve these problems while keeping the size of government down, maybe through free-market or private solutions. Those two competing ideas played a tug-of-war with each other, keeping the excesses of each other in check, and providing competing viewpoints, which sometimes led to better, more comprehensive solutions. These days, however, the Republican Party if essentially just a wing of the MAGA movement, and it accomplished nothing, and it's sole purpose seems to be to disallow any movement forward.
141159	Policy on the economy and immigration
141160	they listen to [CHAR(10)]party people
141162	it's something that they are firm on like crime
141165	They want to do more for the people, community, and country.
141167	I like the fact they are “less gov’t” and believe we should work for what we’ve got.
141169	not steering this country in the wrong path like the Democratic Party
141170	While I don't feel the party is as strong as it was even 10 years ago I agree with its stance on the majority of issues ( particularly not just handing out money to groups but providing opportunities to individuals willing to put for the effort / more helping-hand policies more than handouts )
141172	That it is conservative
141173	Conservative and responsible.
141176	THEIR VALUES--GOD IS RECOGNIZED--THEY ARE FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE
141180	I used to agree with the conservative financial approach. low taxes for middle lower class.
141183	Conservative values
141184	policies. I agree with a strong military strong border school choice
141188	I like some of their conservative view, like on abortion.
141189	seems like there thinking like me
141191	capitalism, smaller government
141194	they want to close the border. They want to tap our natural resources. They want to punish criminals
141195	a firmer stance on illegal immigration
141196	We used to be a party of small government and individual freedom. I don't know what is happening now. I hope the Republican party come back.
141197	Less taxes for higher incomes. Taxes don't take into account student loan burden unfortunately
141198	THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING
141199	The fact they are for the people.
141200	pro life. for a strong economy. for criminal punishment. pro American. anti Illegal. pro life
141205	Good immigration platform
141208	I do think that they do care about how deeply our country is going into debt more than the Dem. do.
141209	They care more about American citizens by lowering prices, keeping illegal immigrants out of the country.
141210	I like the focus on values as well as the fake attempt and giving back to the working man… even though they never do that
141218	Strong American dream values. J D Vances Military service.
141221	save the country ; border security
141222	Protecting individuals rights on certain aspects.
141225	I do feel the Republican party is more patriotic and concerned with the welfare of our citizens, even though I don't agree with every Republican in office. However, they are more in line with my beliefs.
141233	Values, standards & economic growth
141234	Some aspects of pre-MAGA fiscal policy
141235	They’re more for everyday Americans
141239	most of what they stand for
141241	the party is more conservative and more in line with my thinking.
141243	They tell the TRUTH
141244	The Republican party selects their candidates through the peoples' choice at the primaries. The Democrats have the superdelegates who can persuade the votes. I see corruption in both parties, but the Democrats elites have too much power controlling things behind the scenes. The Republican party is the lesser of the 2 evils. There's also tax cuts, a stronger economy, and a stronger military.
141246	They seem very supportive of the military.
141247	economy policies[CHAR(10)]immigration policies
141253	Typically better with budget.
141257	pretty much all of it since it is now ruled by Trump
141260	Republicans as a whole, stand up for the good of the peoples of the US. This means principles of right and wrong. The want people of US to stand for what is right and wrong, not only for themselves, but for country.
141261	The REAL Republicans will call out the extremists in the party and wish to help move this country forward with communicating with their opposing constituents.
141262	appeal to blue collar.
141263	They look out for the people of the United States first and foremost.
141267	As it relates to the historic Republican Party, I like that they focus on enabling and supporting local and state level solutions rather than federal solutions and seek to limit the size and influence of the federal government as much as possible. I liked that they were fiscally responsible. The Republican Party at this very moment shares few if any of those values though and I see it as primarily a cult of personality around Donald Trump.
141269	The Republican party remembers that this country was founded on Christian principles and that God is in control. Democrats have totally forgotten that. Republicans respect the birth of babies. The Republican party recognizes that the border is allowing thousands of criminal illegals to enter this country. The party recognizes that illegals are taking jobs away from LEGAL immigrants and U.S. Citizens and want to put a stop to it as well as closing the border.
141270	less government
141271	more common sense
141274	Conservative values or so they claim.
141276	They are honest, they are getting work done, they stand up to Antisemitism, to crime, to illegal immigration, they make me feel safe, heard and evoke trust
141277	I normally agree with their stance on taxes and war time activites. Not so much since Trump and his administration has made a mockary of the party.
141278	The power of the people, not government and the government being limited.
141281	Not much ---- has become to much of a cult with their fondness for trump
141286	Prior to the tea party and Trump administration I was more center left and there were policies that I could relate to and agree with. Now, there is nothing I can agree with. Today’s Republican Party is not Representative of republicans. Traditional republicans don’t even want to vote republican. Along with anyone that has a conscience or lives in reality
141287	moral stances and freedom to live as we please
141288	More conservative spending of our Tax Dollars..
141291	Recent candidates
141295	There are still a few good moderate party members[CHAR(10)]-- or what would be considered moderates in today's political environment -- who are fighting quietly to hold back the flood and keep our democracy intact and are working with the other side.
141302	In a nutshell, it seems to me that the Rep Party more so aligns with the US Constitution and what America stood for... should still stand for and I believe DOES stand for. The media is missing a very large portion of American's views and convictions. It's not being reported fairly. The Republican Party made great strides for what is right to me from 2016 to 2020, in spite of the media and in spite of during the year 2020 blaming unfairly covid/ untruthfully reporting covid, the short-term tested covid vaccine, and the begin of shut downs that were not absolutely necessary and began changing our economy for the negative. Biden Harris late blamed Trump for all of this and the media ran with it. Sick. Not true. Waste of our time and economy we had experienced. Everyone was better off (except dem leadership).
141303	I believe republicans stand for obeying the constitution, which was built on Christianity and stands for freedom. Republicans allow people to choose if they want to have the pledge of allegiance in schools or if they want to pray; maybe have an American flag on their walls. They have enough common sense to know that guns don't kill people, people kill people. Just look at where all the crime is (Democratic ran cities, that don't allow the innocent to carry guns) They believe in strengthening our military and borders to protect us from our many enemies. Ultimately, I want to have job opportunities based on my skill level, options to buy American made products, eat steak with lots of salt and guzzle adult beverages in my own home without bombs from foreign enemies dropping on me. And when my health gets bad due to my many unhealthy habits, I want healthcare that's affordable.
141307	They are more humane and logical and pro life
141322	back the Blue, military
141328	care about the little guys, the economy
141329	policies
141330	They seem to continue to support Israel.
141332	confidence and experience
141335	Will restore economic growth to our country, protect integrity of election, and will protect our freedom.
141339	border policy.
141340	Budgeting, taxes, insurance reform.
141341	I like that the are more fiscally conservative.
141343	I relate to being somewhat traditional and conservative in some ways
141344	planned border shut down
141349	economic policies, immigration, Christian values
141350	I like where they stand on less government. anytime the government is involved it just goes down hill and money is wasted.
141353	they are a ride or die hard
141354	While I believe life begins at conception, I feel like more republicans (not all) feel abortion should not be as widely available as the Dem party believes it should be. Yes, we all make choices. Where we fall short as a nation, is that if we make abortion illegal, or very limited, we need to step up as a nation in terms of fostercare/adoption to take care of the kids some parents are not healthy enough to support. I feel like our economy is also stronger with a republican in office. That is limited knowledge.
141355	Their stances on border control, energy policies. It’s not feasible to have electric cars that plug in for energy. That doesn’t even make common sense. I like the republicans policies in general.
141359	They are better than the democrats, but they are sliding on a slippery slope.
141360	Their conservative views. They have always stood for the people. They are the party that actually freed the slaves, and fought for their Civil Rights. NOT THE Democrat Party.
141361	economic policies[CHAR(10)]less free money giveaways - ie student loan forgiveness hone down payments. - not responsibility of government
141362	For the most part, agree with their policy positions
141363	They seem more for the people. I think they seem tougher.
141366	want to keep USA a republic and abide by the Constitution.
141369	I like that they are moving towards a more labor/ blue collar base. but i still don't really trust most of the party leadership.
141370	It is a conservative party; has had many presidents that have done a good job in the office of president and vice president; seems to be more down to Earth in decision making
141371	handling boarder restrictions, abortion, oil drilling in us,strengthening military
141375	They embrace lower taxation.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]They are the party that wants to stay out of my business much more than the Democrats, who certainly seem to want to stick their noses in all parts of our lives.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]But, more than anything, they're not the current Democrat party, which has just lurched way too far to the left.
141376	Occasionally they stand up against government overreach.
141377	The traditional Republican values about personal responsiblilty, family, support for Israel.
141378	The Republican party has always lead by the Constitution and lives by One Nation under God.
141379	everything an what were doing to save this country once again
141381	To make america great again
141385	straight logistical business plans
141386	They have better policies regarding the economy and border control. I should not have to work in my 70's to take care of free loading immigrants that want a hand out from the liberals.
141387	The name sounds strong, but the best thing I like about the Republican Party is when they are NOT in the majority.
141391	Specific members inside of it have more values and hold true to the Constitution.
141392	keep immigration to a minimum
141398	the opposition to current illigal immigration policies. fiscal policies.
141400	I change my mind back to no
141401	at least used to hold principles
141403	Stances on family values, crime, immigration, the economy
141405	theat majority rules. that capitalism, even if flowed, is better than socialism. that none pushes their values down my throat and that my kids belong to me and not to the State. That everyone is not equal. that US should have borders to be a country. Another words, America First". "
141406	rule of law and the supreme court.
141407	They want to close the border, lower taxes, increase coal and oil production here in the US
141409	Better with economy

141428	protecting individual freedoms
141429	I feel like people in the Republican Party who act like they oppose things Donald Trump has done always change their minds and give their full support to him. It gives the impression that they will back him even if the decisions aren’t favorable for a majority of citizens.
141430	stands for middle class stands for alot of my beliefs
141431	I’m a conservative, been so my entire adult life. The Republican Party has been taken over by the MAGA cult and they don’t stand for conservative principles.
141432	They are bigger supporters of the pro-life movement and the protection of God created life. They are better able to serve the economy of the American people.
141435	middle class people matter
141438	strong values on what we need against the boarders
141439	Leadership. I believe Mr. Trump has a better understand of what our country needs.
141441	they are for baby right to live

141466	lower taxes and gun rights
141468	The lesser of the 2 party evils
141469	I have always liked the proposed small government of the Republican Party. I don't like the idea of a large national government asserting the same laws for such a large swath of land. They don't ever seem to follow those policies though and just ban everything instead of regulating it.
141470	SK
141471	Seemingly more fiscally responsible. Curbing illegal immigrant crossings. Promotion and support of capitalism. (It has its flaws, but it drives creativity and ingenuity)
141472	in general they want to lower taxes- however I would want it to be more focused on the “little people” since corporations aren’t putting money back into the economy now that stock buy backs are legal again. [CHAR(10)]I’m a hunter and republicans tend to be more pro gun rights. although I do think we can regulate better. [CHAR(10)]
141475	I appreciate financial conservativism, which I believe is important to Republicans... but I guess I don't really know. Nor do I know whether my understanding of the term matches anyone else's for that matter.

141491	I like the patriotism the exhibit -- though I think Democrats are just as patriotic they don't seem to be able to make it part of their brand it as well. I like the idea of fiscal responsibility in government that Republicans are always discussing, but I don't like the way it always seems to come at the expense of the lower classes. I like the idea of building America's strength abroad both diplomatically and militarily. However, I'm not sure the phrasing by the Republicans is the right way to go.
141500	They for the most part are conservative and want less big government..
141501	stronger economic policy and concern about global leadership and security

141514	Smaller government, desire for fiscal responsibility
141517	Trying to get immigration and abortion under control
141519	The real republican party (before MAGA) has some good points when it comes to change and the importance of the family unit.
141522	mainly that there are god-fearing party that they want our economy to be better that they want our country to be number one they care about our people our land our country our veterans firefighters or teachers our schools our economy they're trying to improve and take care of the country like and get it back to what it used to be when people can live in comfort and feel safe we don't have to spend $500 for $30 worth of groceries we can get a tank of gas for less than $80.
141523	gas was cheaper, they just don’t lie as much, times were better, we had our own oil and gas, the border wall was going up

141596	General overall beliefs and conservatism.
141598	we fight to strive to make American people better and form a better country for us
141601	The party needs to find better representation. Trump is an embarrassment. I can't believe that a criminal would be allowed to run for president. He is also too old and has demonstrated many times that it is always about him. He can't participate in a conversation with anyone that questions his past. He just begins making fun of the other person like a bully.
141605	They believe we should keep our borders secure and have no illegal living here that you should come to America legally or go back where you came from
141606	There are a few Reagan Republicans trying to control the MAGA crowd

141638	the economy seems to run better and I have been conservative all my life.
141640	Get rid of the Demonic democratic party. we need righteous people to put God back into the equation. Since God was taken out of education (the schools) we are having mass shootings in school. People need to be taught about God but most welfare rats won't teach their welfare rats about God. People do not respect the law or police or God. When rats are thrown in prison, it is really a vacation for them; they are still running their drug business. I used to be a prison guard and that's what they say

141686	National Security
141687	Traditionally, the Republican party has promoted the values of integrity, restraint in government and sound fiscal policy. I think in the last couple decades that they have drifted further and further away from those core values in favor of crony capitalism and this 1950's myth of the ideal family structure. We need both parties to be strong and offer constructive solutions. Both are necessary for a balanced system of government.
141688	They fight for Christian rights.

141715	They are normal in my mind on most issues and policies. Most of the things they do are good for the country and its people.
141716	The Republican party appears more concerned about our own people, veterans, borders, etc.; whereas the current Democratic party only seems to care about lining their own pockets with money from foreign country affiliations.

141874	The Republican Party, in general, stands for moderate, right leaning stands in issues concerning the economy, upholding the rule of law on immigration, building a stronger military force, and conducting foreign policy to project peace through strength throughout the world. We stand closer now to armed worldwide conflict in my lifetime since the Cuban missile crisis in the sixties. We seem to have an axis of bad actors and potentially bad actors coming together against Isreal and the United States. My fear is that we're not doing much of anything presently to deter such a conflict. I believe republicans would certainly do a much better job of keeping peace in the world and allowing cooler heads to prevail.

While i have nothing against the LBGTQI+ community and would support my kids in whatever choice they end up making —as adults— im not okay with all this exposure and exploration for 3 year olds.

142387	They love the country and the American people are 1st. They are against all the crazy insane thoughts of the Democrat communist party.
142388	Republican Party has stood up against antisemitism on campuses and taken the same side as immigration skeptics, gender critical feminists, and pro-natalists. However, the Republican solutions to these problems are opportunistic and simplistic, pushing socially conservative policies that they favor anyway, rather than seeking honest answers to these extremely complicated questions. Banning medical care will not address the underlying reasons that adolescents seek out transgender services and a couple of years later realize that they didn't want them, or the underlying reasons that people are not marrying and having 2+ kids. Banning books and university courses will not reverse campus antisemitism. Banning immigration will not prevent trafficking by drug cartels across the Darien gap or other dangerous routes into the US, and reducing foreign aid and isolationism will increase immigration. If Republicans were intellectually honest about solving these problems, they would engage in bipartisan solutions. The world faces enormous problems, and the Republicans are obstructionist and not open to collaborations necessary to solve these large problems.
142389	I like the Republican Party’s conservative values
142392	I favored their mentality of drilling on US property and having the economy affordable

142409	They have slightly more common sense.They understand we cant let everyone come here. America gets a bad rap. Certain liberal Americans say the Republicans are racist for not letting all immigrants come here but other countries dont let anyone.
142417	The Republican party USED TO BE the party that stayed out of your life, bedroom and respected privacy, now they want to tell us who we can read, and what we can do with our bodies and want to know what we do in the bedroom....they have changed to the invasive species.

142442	it's ability to change, to embrace the common american's plight
142443	The Republican Party used to stand for and believe in limited government regulation, a strong national defense, and states' rights. It emphasized liberty, economic prosperity, and preserving American values - and once upon a time it focused on election integrity and national security… THAT was the true Republican Party…… this party no longer exists.

235974	Critics of the Republican Party in the United States often raise several concerns about the party's policies and approach. Here are some points commonly cited by those who oppose the party:[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 1. **Resistance to Climate Change Action**[CHAR(10)] - **Climate Policy:** The Republican Party has been criticized for its reluctance to acknowledge and address climate change. Many Republican leaders have questioned the science behind climate change and opposed regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This resistance is seen by critics as dangerous, given the global consensus on the need for urgent action to combat environmental degradation.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 2. **Healthcare and Social Safety Nets**[CHAR(10)] - **Healthcare:** Republicans have consistently opposed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare. Their attempts to repeal or weaken it have raised concerns about millions losing their health insurance. Critics argue that the party's healthcare proposals often prioritize market-based solutions that do not adequately cover vulnerable populations.[CHAR(10)] - **Social Programs:** The party has supported cuts to programs like Medicaid, food assistance, and other social safety nets. Opponents argue that these cuts disproportionately harm low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 3. **Tax Policy and Economic Inequality**[CHAR(10)] - **Tax Cuts for the Wealthy:** The Republican Party has championed tax cuts that critics argue overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and large corporations. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for example, reduced the corporate tax rate and provided significant tax relief to high-income individuals, which opponents say exacerbates economic inequality.[CHAR(10)] - **Wealth Inequality:** Critics argue that Republican economic policies contribute to growing wealth inequality in the U.S., as they often prioritize deregulation and tax policies that favor the wealthy and corporate interests over workers and middle-class families.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 4. **Social Issues and Civil Rights**[CHAR(10)] - **LGBTQ+ Rights:** The Republican Party has been criticized for its stance on LGBTQ+ rights, including opposition to same-sex marriage and transgender rights. Some Republicans have supported measures that critics say would allow discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals in the name of religious freedom.[CHAR(10)] - **Reproductive Rights:** The party has taken strong anti-abortion positions, advocating for policies that restrict access to abortion and other reproductive healthcare services. Critics argue that these positions undermine women's rights and bodily autonomy.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 5. **Immigration Policies**[CHAR(10)] - **Harsh Immigration Stance:** The Republican Party, particularly under Donald Trump, has taken a hardline stance on immigration. Policies like family separation at the border, the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, and the push to build a border wall have been widely condemned by human rights organizations and critics for being inhumane and xenophobic.[CHAR(10)] - **Opposition to Comprehensive Immigration Reform:** Republicans have often opposed comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, leading to continued uncertainty and fear among immigrant communities.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 6. **Voting Rights and Democracy**[CHAR(10)] - **Voter Suppression:** The Republican Party has been accused of supporting and enacting voter suppression tactics, such as strict voter ID laws, purging voter rolls, and limiting access to early voting and mail-in ballots. Critics argue these measures disproportionately affect minority voters, young people, and the elderly, undermining democratic participation.[CHAR(10)] - **Questioning Election Integrity:** In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, many Republicans supported claims of widespread voter fraud, despite the lack of evidence. Critics argue that this undermines trust in democratic institutions and can lead to political instability.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 7. **Public Health and Science**[CHAR(10)] - **COVID-19 Response:** The Republican Party, particularly during Trump's presidency, faced criticism for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics argue that the party downplayed the severity of the virus, resisted public health measures like mask mandates, and spread misinformation about vaccines, contributing to preventable deaths and prolonged the pandemic.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 8. **Polarization and Extremism**[CHAR(10)] - **Rise of Extremism:** Critics argue that the Republican Party has not done enough to distance itself from extremist elements, including white supremacist groups and conspiracy theorists. The party's rhetoric and policies are seen as contributing to increased polarization and social tension.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 9. **Judicial Appointments**[CHAR(10)] - **Conservative Judiciary:** Republicans have prioritized the appointment of conservative judges to federal courts, including the Supreme Court. Critics argue that this has led to a judiciary that may roll back civil rights, reproductive rights, and environmental protections for decades to come.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]### 10. **Foreign Policy**[CHAR(10)] - **America First Approach:** The Republican Party, particularly under Trump, adopted an merica First foreign policy, which critics argue weakened alliances, diminished U.S. influence abroad, and made the world less stable. Critics are concerned that this approach could lead to a more isolationist and less cooperative global stance.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]These critiques reflect the concerns of those who believe the Republican Party's policies and actions are harmful to various aspects of American society, including the environment, social justice, democracy, and global relations. However, it's important to recognize that these are perspectives from opponents of the party, and supporters would likely offer counterarguments emphasizing their belief in individual freedom, economic growth, national security, and conservative values.

313118	a lot of the things they say about economics and spending 
314001	i guess some of the policies they hve are better for long term 
314093	gear towards getting more jobs 
314130	i do like the concept in theory of small government and ideas local and state communities having some self determination i like that on many issues i am generally a physically conservative person and the republican party at least historically has advocated for those particular eleemnts that would be the only 2 elements that resonate with me that I can think of 
314131	I think that the party operates in general in good faith to try to advance their policies which often disagree with but I don't have an issue with most of the party. I appreciate that they are patriotic and not ashamed of America. 
314172	I just feel they're solidly conservative. They're not going to fly off into some liberal program that hasn't been carefully considered. I think they'll study up on a program until they launch into it, but this is just my feeling. /AE/ They're conservative, I guess that'll do it. /AE/ No. 
314336	I think they are adhesion to the constitution and it has to be compared to the Democrats and less spending, but they'll spend like everybody else. /AE/ Personal freedom, sovereignty, they tend to stay out of my life. /AE/ That's enough. 
314425	conservative values generall expredssed as a party platform ae/ no thats ll inclusive 
314703	I feel like they're more for the people. I feel like the Republicans are actually for the people and instead of saying it, they're doing it. /AE/ No, that's it. 
314803	they seem to be a stronger party/ae/seems to be a backbone and a better wasy to get things done quicker/ae/I am pro life /ae/no

315741	my daughter and my whole families like republican party / ae / no 
315761	They love America. /AE/ They've got a lot of problems, they're politicians, so it's hard to get behind a politician that you know is just lying. I was a democrat for years but I turned right a long time ago when I saw that the democrats weren't what they used to be. I started voting at 30. /AE/ They still believe in God and education and our children and at least they're trying. I know some of these kids graduating high school and can't spell their name. /AE/ No. 
315762	Mostly because they do things that I feel is better for the country /AE/ No because it's changed a lot to from what it used to be.

316251	The actual Republican party, not the one that we have now, that holds the core values of the nation that beileve and encourage self-reliance /AE/ No 
316326	More for the economy, keeping things in our country, jobs and stuff /AE/ No 
316336	I do think that some of their policies do do good things for some things in our ecomony that ehlps; but I dont think it works 
316385	Less government, they're supposed to be fiscally conservative, which they're not anymore. The ideal is there but right now it's a cultish personality, it's not your traditional republican values. Our party has been hijacked by this jack ass of a cultish personality. /AE/ That's it. 
316400	I think they just have better policy in general. 
316434	They care are about working middle class people. On the whole their integrity is real. support Israel. 
316600	The republican party in order to make for money you have to work for whatever you might need in like nothing is free. Energizing make you want to move and be about something. Might be sitting down and make you stand up on your feet to take care of your business. 
316605	though I am a democrat I like that there is a two party system I like the concept of a conservative party it has value in helping us articulate a range of issues which I think is a healthy dynamic for democracy /ao/ not these days 
316747	the old republican party was okay, the new one is not good, they are after the oponents, the family members, the character that s not good, they got a problem with the truth, speaking the truth

321089	I like the more realistic focus on the working poor /AE/ It seems like the economy is always better when a republican is in office and I know people think that the economy is better now becuase of stocks and stuff but it's not better for people like me who live off of regular income /AE/ No 
321149	I like that it's economy focused, it's their main selling point, that they care about the economy /AE/ That's really it

323181	Abortion, immigration, the economy/ae/no 
323222	some of the conservative policies, 
323299	They are now the people's party. Their approach to military, state run vs. federal run government. Their spiritual aspect. Their respect for life. Their approach to the education system. I feel they are more honest. 
323544	I like the part of the party that is still in favor of upholding the Constitution. But as an overall party, I don't think they're actions are upholding the Constitution/ae/no 
323636	a third of the peep in that party are still concerned about the peeps they represent.

325425	They seem like they stick together more and theyre not araid to get their hands dirty to achieve a goal or get what they want. They arent scary.

325792	Their position on abortion. That's it. /AE/ No. 
325892	they supposeedly stand for strong chritian valus in america first but they are slipping away from those principals, they tend to live and tend to alow people to live their lives without government intervention live be on your own be independant, i believe they are more accepting of socal valus than dems even thought they may disagree/ao/no

I really really feel that the the whole picture of everything. Each party, but more the democrat, is fighting, but no one wants to do the fabric and have the threads o for the good fo this country. I feel that this is hurting us I feel that they should put the party aside, put the people aside, get the whole picture. Don't put the democrats name on it dont put the republicans name on it. If we want to get better that's what we need. Just fighting, the mic is on the mic is off, the debate stuff and everything. Just go with it! That's how I feel. /AE/ No.

329850	Everything that I know and heard. 
329893	Yeah I do, I feel like they are more family oriented. And more for like the people. They say that's the opposite, they say that the Republicans are for the rich and that the Democrats are for middle class but I don't feel that it is that way. /AO/ NO 
330021	like some of the things they say tey stand for like strong family values ae/ like how they bring up immigation issues because i think it'simportant for visibility ae/ no 
330139	I think they try to follow what the constitution says instead of their interpretations. I think the Republican party is trying to give the people what they need rather than what the government wants. I think they're a better party, not perfect, but better. /AE/ That's pretty much it. 
330186	They do have some favorable policies towards business that I approve, and I do approve of their fiscal conservatism in some areas. /ae/No 
330331	The fact that. Seems more hard work dedication will get you where you want to go, earning your keep.

RNC is more not supporting other countries, we'll never get it all back, not familiar with it but he thinks they say take care of yourself.

330348	Capilalism, taxation, defence, 
330767	I think they are braver, more organized, and more effective. Um, I like how they speak to the many issues that are most important to the majority of americans regardless of their gender, sexual identity, religion, social class, race, ethnicity. Basically all the traps that the democrats get into. /AE/um, this kind of comes off weird but I like that they defend to an extent some traditional values. Or at least they say to defend some traditional values. /AE/ no 
330886	i like DT stands the REP party out he was for everyone and noticing we needed stimulus and PPP and student forgiveness he really set a tone for REP/ao/he helps everyone, for so long during school we were saying REP took from people and rich people and DEMs were for people but now DT stands for people/ao/no

331126	more up front about how they feel, not sure that they get the whole picture /ao/ no 
331168	i like their stance on gun control or gun rights i like their stance on immigration and that's all im gonna say on that 
331180	The old or the new republican party? Their immigration stand. Their monetory policy stand. And their regulatory stand. And their abortion stand. Oh, Energy stand. /AO/ No

331565	They're trying to secure the borrder. I don't know how well they're going to do, but they're trying to stop that. They do believe in letting you speak the truth even if it might piss someone off. /AE/ They ain't gonna come after your guns but, I don't think anyone could anyways cause it's in the constitution. I mean not all guns you can't have a 50 caliber cannon sitting on your driveway. /AE/ That's about it. 
332094	i think they are more for businesses, they do better for the stock market, they're tougher on giving benefits to people who don't work, 
332332	The economy is better everything they are in there, gas is lower and groceries cheaper and no problms with the immigrants/ao/ no 
332687	I guess to me they are actually trying ti help the us citizens insted of sending tons of money to other countries /ao/ We are supposed to help them but we laso need to help our us citizens and our homeless better. /ao/thats it 
332721	their pro life/their immagration reform policies/their economic plans/ao/no 
332912	i think that the traditional republican principals were reasonable and have merit even if I disagreed, I still felt their positions had merit and were worthy of consideration/ae/no 
333005	what they stand for because I stand for /ao/ I feel like they represent my religious beliefs /ao/ that's the main thing /ao/ their economy sounds better /ao/ no 
333335	like their stance on the ecomony and seems like they think about america first and the religious values that some of them have 
333687	Thomas Massie, there's a couple of Republicans that tend to lean very liberatarian. I like Rand Paul, I expecially like Rand Paul's father Ron Paul. I appreciate the way they lean into calling out government waste and croneyism in general. Unfortunately Ron Paul is no longer in politics, he's an old man. /AO/ There are some other people but I don't know that they are still involved in the republican party, Justin Amash from Michigan. But I don't think he is currently in government, unfortunately. I think a lot of the younger Republicans in congress are doing a lot to change the GOP and transform it into something a little more freedom loving. /AO/ NO 
333718	That there strong on building a strong economy and they're strong on backing against abortion. 
333756	I like the Republican Party's history. I like that fact that they are pretty predictable. You always know what they are going to do. They are pretty off base right now but historically they are pretty on. i think they have lost their way. I fear they are going to kill themselves off and that they are going to damage themselves severly by the people they are willing to get into bed with./ae/no 
333773	They are conservative and are carefu;l with our money., 
333889	their decisions / ae / no 
334077	i think most of them follow my belief, my religious belief, and most of them , I'm a retired military, I think most of them view the military favorably, 
334153	seems that they try get done what the people want, 
334509	I like that they talk a good game, they don't always deliver but they talk a good game. Every 2 or 4 years they move in that direction. They might not do everything they say but at least they try and are keeping things from deteriorating. /AE/ No not really 
334700	they're outspoken, they know where they are coming from /ao/ thats it. 
334801	I agree more with their policies than the other party/AE/No. 
334817	I like that they want to make a change and thats is what we need/ae/

335043	very straight foward ppl who kno wwhat they want ppl may not agree on agenda but they are very strict on agenda no bluffs 
335208	There are things I liked about the old Republican party but I don't know if they exist any more. It seems like the party has been taken over and it doesn't seem like it exists anymore. Like remember how they used to be the party of law and order and now they've let someone come in and take over who's a convicted criminal. Remember when they were saying, lock up Hillary? For what? /AE/ I liked John McCain and Mitt Romney and Adam Kinsinger, these people who seem to care about the country more than their party or their leader. /AE/ No 
335285	I just I just trust them more, more about trust than anything else//ao// no //like I said, I'm not political knowledable so//ao// no 
335388	Their views on abortion and their general fiscal ideals as well as most of their opinions on gun control and things being local management instead of national. A/E No 
335580	More honest/ae/seems like they are actually trying to help the country out and make it better/ae/no 
335760	Man, far more complicated. They tend to promote the opposite of everything I just sd about the Democrats. I'm good with that. 
335788	they are constantly doing things to help us 
335830	I like their talk of smaller govt and lower taxes and their supposed tough stance at the boarder/AO/I like their stance on the 2A to a point/AO// 
336184	Their former stance on fiscal responsibility. Their former stance on military policy. 
336218	 fiscal responsibility thought I am not sure that happens anymore /ao/ no 
336278	Again it comes down to the individual that is representing the party. I do generally tend to like the Republican party because they tend to be more conservative. /AO/ NO 
336325	they stand for america first, they want to keep our country safe, make our communities safe, right now we have a lot of bad things going on, they want to have our national resources developed instead of another countrys resources pumped in here, I like that their giving states the choice on abortion issues. they stand for closing the border to stop the flow of illegal immigration 
336525	Sometimes they're for smaller government, and more cost saving sometimes /AE/ no 
336728	I think some of their historical policies and positions were good back in the cold war era when they supported democracy and NATO and trying to generally stop the spread of communisim so that history of the republicn party, you look back favorablly on them for that. I grew the regan presidency and I admired his optimisim and some of his foriegn policies.A/E 
336818	iI feel like in america that you should stand on our own two feets to support yourself and make a livelyhood for your family. I feel that there is less red tap in business with republicans in office and I'm a business owner//ao// I like that they value the life of an unborn child all though I belive in case of rap or other terrible situations that abortion should be an option such as the mother life being in danger//ao// 
336854	they unerstand the people/AO/No 
337080	jsut feel the republicans want to represent the working class more. theyll work harder to overall protect us, health care, economy. overall for working class people. some things trump promisg to make things alittle easier 
337211	seem to have values that follow mine/AE/no 
337361	the Republican party at the moment for me is meeting my future goals for me and my family AE 
337374	I do admire their love of country, 
337421	Less taxes, less big government. /AE/ No 
337848	I just like how they handle situations /AE/ No 
338080	I like that fiscally then the democratic party, I would say that it is less likely that tax payers money would spent . 
338347	theres a group of 12 senators who are willing to cross the aisle for legislation/ae/some are willing to cross the aisle to support the Harris ticket/ae/no 
338430	they dont want to take our guns/ae/ they want the borders closed so not just any Illegal Immigrant can come in/ae/ listen to trump who said he would lower inflation or do away with it/ae/ they Promise to focu on american Peeps other than Immigrants./ae/no

341784	I like that they want to bring budgets under control and reduce taxes /ae/ No 
341794	Um, I think during the time that they are in that our economy is better, as far as our groceries and gas and stuff like that seems to be better when they are in office, just better decision making that's more for the people and more concern for what's going on in the country /AE/ that's good enough, I think that's fine 
341865	their views on immigration, how they handle the economy, their tax politics, and probably just mainly those are the key items. AE their policies on gun control AE i think that's probably the main stuff 
341904	I guess when I hear what people have to say about the Republican party, because I have friends on both sides, I hear that they want to put more money in peoples pockets, it's more about the bottom line for them. /AO/ No 
341906	I think they do a better job with foreign affairs /AE/ No

342720	i like the fact that they want to close the border, i think theyre in control of our national international leaders, i like what theyre trying to get away from all the favors they ae doing for the illegals and concentrate on people in our own country , i don't believe theyll mess with meidicare and social security, i like the fact that they wan to leave the abortion as a state issue, i do not want federal control over our education, food prices, i don't believe in a socialist country and i do believ that is the kind of direction they seem to going in.

343288	I like that they at least purport to what to lower the deficit. 
343512	they're more fiscally responsible, i like their stance on immigration,

343863	I think will be the president and he is good for the people. he is easily than others 
343884	The Republican Party is more supportive of border control and citizens' freedoms. 
344010	I do like the fact that they are trying to keep financial status in mind. We as a country need to make sure that we are supporting all of our own assets, and I have no probelm helping out other countries, I am all about it, but we need to make sure we are covering all of our bases, and I feel that the republican party is a very financial state of mind, and I think that could be good for the economy. /AE/ Um, not off the top of my head no. 
344206	Well, when they say something, they'll do it. Democrats, they'll ponder around and, find all kinds of excuse. /AE/ No that's about it.

344307	They are for the middle class. /AE/ no 
345194	(Laughing) I'm not good at this, okay, umm...I'm more of a conservative. And, I feel that the Republican party aligns more with my beliefs and values. /AO/ Umm, like my stance on immigration, I believe that people should obey the laws and go through the process to be her legally. Or like with spending, were hearing about the Democratic party sending all this money overseas to help them and then the Hurricane that came through, we should be sending our funds to help the American people before were sending it overseas. I think the republican party can help us get in a better financial position to help the American people first and then help other countries when they need aid. /AO/ no 
345378	I like that their policies and views that if you work hard - I have friends from foreigh countries that are more socialist, i don't know what it's like there, you can come from nothing and still build yourself up, that we still have freedom of speech even though I know it's not going too well right now. I was trying to say the friends can earn a better living/have a better life here. Some we forget that America is the land of the free. /ae/ 
345578	focus on econimics 
345802	I like that there are members of the Republican party who do speak up on principal and speak to what are actually their values and how Trump and others dont fit that,I believe there are members of the Republican party who have best intent and endeavor to work in a bipartisan fashion/ae/ no 
345806	I like that they are now the party of the working class where democrats are not party of the elites /ao/ I like their policies. I am on a fixed income and I am paying 22% of federal taxes from social security check. 85% of social security is taxed.

345922	Family oriented policy /AE/ No 
346005	I believe that they try to, or have tired to adhere to the constitution, and base the discussions, and make the laws based on the constitution. But the infighting and politics that's happened with the republican party recently, I don't see that happening. /AE/ At the moment no. 
346089	I am in awe sometime of theuir unfiltered and unfettered loyalty towards someone who's a crazy person who clearly does not want to do anything for the betterment of the country, only betterment for themselves. /AE/ Not necessarily like but in awe of the fact that if any democrat says one thing, it automatically gets twisted to comething that's off-topic, their spin ability is insane. /AE/ No, not so much. 
346091	Right now it would be getting back to the stabilization in the country. /AE/ No. 
346093	I like their fiscal policies or what they used to be/ae/no 
346628	I'm trying to think of some reasons. I think that during their reign interest rates are lower so it makes it easier to buy houses but at the same time that leads to higher national debt. /ae/ I'm having some hard times coming up with reasons so that's all for now. 
346848	I like how the Republican party wants citizens to be independent and not rely so much on the government. I like how they don't like taxes so much. 
346911	first abraham lincoln, strong roots and good things, too focused on the person who makes money instead of the person who produces the wealth/ae/ used to be a conservative influence that we need sometimes/ae/not much 
347066	position on gun rights,better on consitutional rights , 
347406	i think their are a few old resplublicans athat seem to do their djob in a certain way like mitt romney/ao/no 
347472	I like that they try to conserve money I guess the money of the country I feel they conserve it beter they conserve oyr finances better /ao/ I like that they tend to lean on more of family values I feel They might put families first I guess from what they say /ao/ I like thathey have an unwavering support for america /ao/ There are good candidates in the republican party . I like the republican party. I just dont like the candidate for presindet. In the future I feel like I could vote for republican As I used to be one but now Im not. /ao/ No 
347580	Stance on abortion /AE/ Their pro-business stances I do like that /AE/ No 
347603	everything, one they don't lie like the democrats, using what republicans say and say they have done that the republicans have done !E like the way pres trump in the past make the border closed and adding to it and trying to make it better AE his relationships with other world leaders we don't seem to have the problems we have now AE just waiting for him to become pres so he can make it better again. 
348052	They seem to work together better. They're more in the line on not spending so much money like the Dems. /AE/ They seem to be more in favor of working for the american people than the dems. /AE/ That's all I got I guess. 
348423	Their values of fiscal management has an appeal. Some of their views are more exteme than where I stand but the their views on abortion and human sexuality are closer to my values than the democratic party/ae/no

348962	Their political values AE NO 
349098	generally more moderate REP are willing to negociatia accoss the ailes, and I approve of RE who want to approve good economic plans; 
349141	It seems to me that they are trying to get legislation passed that is working for the people/ae/I really don't know about the Repuclican Party. I just started watching them in 2020/ae/I like the idea of both parties to being bipartisan and working together to solve problems rather than creating problems or extending problems/ae/no 
349153	stance on military /ao/ and the border /ao/ no 
349275	The try to push jobs for the country 
349373	they handle things differently than the democrats /ao/ 
349381	They are more for the people/ae/no 
349414	The only reason I like tRUMP and the Republican party is because they are about benefiting the people and helping them. Most products you buy if its American made its a good product but if yo buy some of this other crap it costs a fortune and doesn't last. I think everything in America should be good quality. I think we need to concentrate on making Americas products better and bot buying foreign products that arent worth a crap 
349479	When were looking at a leader, you need someone coherent, Vance is well spoke and smart. We should have someone with strong leadership. Vance carries himself very well, and has strong confident answers. My values line themselves with Republicans just because how of and where I grew up. Trump rougher on foreign affairs, helping to keep manufacture factories here, I like the way the carry themselves about being clear and concise answers. Just being able to carry themselves strongly is a good thing. 
349491	My beliefs are same, policy on abortion, keeping sexes separate, their beliefs on improvement in the economy

Depending on foreign oil we have to depend on foreign il we have so much here. We have to buy pharmaceuticals, our military is weak, keep foreign countries from buying up our land. Let us protect ourselves first nadtake care of our people first so that we can be a strong prosperous nation ao/no 
351012	some goals they have in mind 
351650	I think they're handling things a little calmer right now than the democratic party /ae/ no 
352166	They try to be fair, they try. They so what is this word, you know how you don't see on the left or the right, they see straight ahead. And, you really do try to do the right thing. /AO/ They can use some young blood. They need to retire too and put something in there new to help them out. Because the world is changing, you know, because they are looking so much straight ahead but you are not looking around you. Take a moment and look around you. /AO/ No 
352264	The sense on how to run the economy and that how we are trying to fix the US first before others.ae/thats it 
352538	there favorable towards people who have a lot of money

352953	They're against abortion. They want to get the econ going again. I think their foriegn policy is a lot better. /ae/no 
353415	I like, at least they say, that they would like to put more power to the states and pull back power from the federal government. /AE/No 
353659	Right now it'd be completely opposite of what I just told you, right now they're the group standing for the american people, and individuals. They're trying to protect our nation by trying to do something about the border, illegal aliens coming across the border, I think they're just trying to help the american people, whereas the other party's not. /ae/ I know all the republican people are not exactly what they say, but I believe the majority of them are, and I believe they are warm hearted and trying to help us /ae/ no 
353983	Immigration is out of control, like the conservative who are classical, they are more anti- EV policy 
354122	Decrease in government spending. /AE/ 
354233	The economy was when they were in office, housing was better, interest rates were better, lower gas prices, could afford things, people were safer, other countries seemed to be respectful of our country, not a laughing stock, some of the leaders are afraid of Donald Trump or had respect for him, all say that he's a busnineessm an ran it like a business and it ran good, doesn't see anything wrong with that. /Ae/ No 
354361	The republican party is for the people /AE/ They're trying to give back power to us as citizens /AE/ and restore what it is to be a democracy which is the power of the people over government to make choices and what best suits us is the people and not what suits the government /AE/ No

354599	their conservative agenda, but not the Magna extremist, portion of that, 
355008	Que manejo mejor la economia /ao/ No 
355272	Lower taxes. more money in your pocket no matter how you look at it. and thats the main difference a democrat wants to take from somebody and a repulican wants to earn and share. and we can go back to regan economics it's the trickle down and it works./ae/no 
355323	They are better with the economy/ae/no 
355622	Some economics, 
355699	i like their economic view points, their views on immigration and income tax or taxes in general, foreigh policy i like 
355971	What I like, they're patriotic, they, Im conservative in that I don't like to make big moves, I like to do things in increments and I'm more comfortable in policies like that. I'm not married but I believe in family issues and taking care of family, it's important for kids to grow up with two parents. I mean I care about the kids. And republicans generally stand for strong military, we need to protect our country. Freedom seems much more important to the republican party these days. People need to be self-reliant and hard-working, not assume that the government is oging to take care of them. /AE/ I think that's it. 
356695	I like how much they push for the farmers and whatnot, the little men /AE/ Nothing else that I can think of in all honesty 
356722	I feel like they handle the economy better and i also fell like i can trust them more than the democrats/ae/I like the way they handle immigration/ae/no

357072	some conservative things can be good but I dont think thats how the GOP is today/ae/i think some things from the GOP were good in the past small government can have its place./ae/ 
357625	I like that we have a two party system, period. /AE/ No, Not in today's connotation of the republican pary anyway. 
357747	It's a party that still holds to its conservative values, they believe in the constitution and it's not something that isn't supposed to change, it's an anchor. I believe the republicans are fighting to maintain the essence of the constitution written by the founding fathers. /AE/ Republican party is trying to maintain the core essence of the republic. /AE/ I'm talking about the Judeo-Christian values that we as a nation were formed under. The republican party is party of common sense not nuvo thinking. /AE/ That's it. 
357891	Every now and then you run into one that actually cares about the country. Not terribly opposed to pro business economics. 
357911	lower taxes / ae / economic was better / ae / cost living was less / ae / border security was better /ae /better relationship with other countries / ae /no 
358037	Their views on money /ae/ no

358730	They are master strategizers. /AO/ The fact that nobody really seems to like Donald Trump but they all seem to get behind him, is amazng to me. They are very clear about what their end game is. /AO/ No. 
358765	They strongly support the nuclear family. They do not accept the idea of transgenderism as openly as the democratic party. Most of their economic policies I agree with. There are some exceptions however. I don not think they are as nice or open to immigrants who are coming here but I do respect that they try to put things in practice to not let whoever in. But, I do wish the they woud come up with an immigration reform which is what Trump has mentioned already. I do like their views on race and I like their view on foreign policy mostly, with the excepption of some things. I like that they support the cops. And as opposed to the democratic party one of the first things they mention is an anti cop organization. Umm, I like their view on, i just generally feel that the economy does better under a republican congress or president and /AO/ I also like their views on drugs particular to marijuana as opposed to what Kamala wants to do about that issue. They are also a religious party. Their platform mentions God numerous times and being religious myself I like that. /AO/ No 
358780	pro business , lower taxes for workers /ao/no 
358797	Sense of community /ae/ that is all. 
359053	Their stance on crime, their perception on how to handle crime, that would be the biggest point, crime /AE/ No 
359188	I feel like they are trying to get inflation down. They try to keep illegal immigrants from coming into the country. They want fracking, the Democrats don't. /AO/ I just feel that the Republican party is trying to get the country back to where it was during the Regan years. /AO/ No 
359281	La inmigracion /AE/ No 
359345	use to stand for not alot of death seems to be the party of very good values, I dont see that any more. 
359646	their or conservative on abortion and meney; they tend to not raise taxes; they are more conservative being taught in schools; in geeral I ten to lean towards the conservative party aily for those reasons 
359760	They're letting americans be americans following the constitution. /AE/ They seems to put america first, they have pride in their country and their roots. /AE/ A lot but that covers the main issues I'm concerned about. 
359773	more orient towards middle class or working class people//ao// no 
359882	The only thing I like is that their trying. A/E Yes I am hopeful with the republicans. I know that Trump has done good before so I am hoping that if he is elected things will pick up. A/E No 
359989	I'm sure there are a lot of wonderful people running for offices, other than the presidency, that have, I just want to say that maybe are not so much for the trump situation /AE/ No 
360129	I do appreciate their..I do see benefit of smaller rather than bigger government and i do see that capitalism has it's place/ae/given that i grew up on a farm in the rural Midwest, I know my family benefits from the Republican Party/ae/no 
360494	When Donald Trump was president, the economy was good. I like Republicans. His policies are good; his relations with foreign countries are better than Biden's, to be honest. /ae/ That's the thing.

361718	i think some of them like Liz Cheney are well intentioned, I think members of the party get swept along with the people who are really in power, and like Liz Cheney but they are few and far in between. 
362090	They work for the people and they are honest and that they're trying to help the country not hurt it. /AE/ No 
362168	I like a lot of their policies, their platform AE 
362604	I like their economic policy, in practice it is practially good; I think they work better in practice, and I also apporve of their abortions plicyies; and I think we have shifted in s direction that the repiblican party supports the middle class more that the democtatic party does; 
362661	I feel that the R party wants to protect and honor individual freedoms, I appreciate the conservative fiscal responsibilities and the execution of those reponsibilites, I appriciate in particular my religious freedoms 
362782	Well the republicans are now what the democratic party used to be they're a party for the people /AE/ Yes, uh they're uh, they get out with the people you know they don't stay behind closed doors and hide /AE/ yeah, they're um uh, they mean what they say they're not out to lie to you just to get a vote /AE/ Yes there's all kinds of stuff, a lot of things, they're for the american people not against /AE/ yeah but it would take too long for me to digest the question and answer it properly so let's just go on

363801	They seem to push family values. I like that as a whole but I what they think are family values are skewed and old fashioned. What they see as family values has not changed since the 1920s. they seem very economy focused which I like. I think a strong economy is important. /AE/I dont think so. 
363934	like fiscal conservatism, strong foreign policy, and republican party cares more abt that

365212	the family values /ao/ no 
365449	Very much like the old republican party, I don't feel as if the republicanparty is the same as it used to be, I like the conservative views Ijust felt that things were handled better. I'm going back to Ronald Regan, Goldwater, and what I rememeber from my father going back so far. They are pretty much opposite how the democracts are.

367960	Some of their ideas I guess. /AE/

388827	being on code is a term when ever they have a push that they want to push they all get together and they push it they are on code and they push the code instead of all the arguing and bickering they stay and

388982	I like what they stand for, the policies, I like the fact that they follow the rules. /AE/ That's good. 
389028	their stance on gun control, um, the stances on immigration /AE/ the legitimate support of direct funds back into the school system /AE/ how they don't force and push some weird and untrue agena /AE/ no

389969	I like their policies on immigration better and taxes. 
390206	Their views align more with mine being conservative and sticking to what I believe the founding fathers intended for the country. 
390407	I like that they want to shut down the border and run our immigration system properly, vetting people, I like that. I like the fact that they're not going to kill the second amendment, and I wasn't too crazy at first when they did away with Roe V Wade, but I understand why they did, they put it with the states so in that regard I don't have a problem. They seem to be coming out for everybody, they don't seem to be coming out just for the rich people, I could be wrong. And they want law and order. I don't think well, you can see that the big cities that were destroyed with the fires and everything with the riots, where they tied the hands of the police were democrat cities! The republican cities you didnt see any of that and that's important. And poor connecticut is about 80 percent democrat, about that. Which didn't bother me until all of these crazy things were going on. They came when we had the census, they went to my friend's house, they wanted her to tell them about how many rooms she had, how many people lives there, how many baths she had, how many bedrooms they had. They claimed they wer from the census, and they said e need extra hosing in your area we need more housing with disabled seniors! They want to put illegal immigrants with disabled seniors! If I hadn't seen it myself, I told that woman, I said I just brought her home, the owner of the condo, brought her home from the hospital, I told the person to get the hell out of here. The person said on't you want to offer your home for these people? I couldn't believe it, if I hadn't seen it myself. /AE/ I don't know, it's hard to like parties but I like the way the majority is trying to keep the peace and run the country. /AE/ No that's plenty. 
390479	I think it's really important to have more than one party, so even though I align myself with the Democratic party, I believe it's important to have more than one option. With that said, I think that what the Republican party promotes today is very different than what the Republican party promoted when I was first learning about politics. In the past, I felt the Republican party was a home for people with a more conservative viewpoint, who still respected democracy and I felt there was a sense of mutual respect between members of the Republican party and members of the Democratic party, and I hope there are still people like that within the Republican party today, but largely I think the respect for democracy and the respect for different viewpoints has been lost from the Republican party. /ae/ No. 
390533	yes because that's what this nation was founded on was a Republic /AE/ they stand by our rights as people /AE/ that's all 
390574	thet try to stay conservative and attempting to maintianing smaller goernment ae/thats it

391904	They are conservative/ae/no 
391919	They handle budget deficits in the past pretty well and more business centered as well. /AE/ That's it.

392210	they support our military 100% /ao/ no

392584	my values are more conservative, i guess my answers are going to be similar, I like their view on the economy more, i liek their support of law enforcement, and the resources that are given to armed services 
392811	I think they take into consideration the majority of the people in America, the things we like the things we want. They uphold the Constitution better. /AO/ I think they are more family oriented too. /AO/NO 
392941	I truly believe that the Republican Party believes in the constitution and wants to stand by it. I believe they are for the people. /ae/And small government/ae/no 
392961	stance on abortion and conservative morals; 
393194	the capitlaisut mindset; focus on less government; um I am a Christian and I believe the line more with my personal values, and I think they are more true to what our country was founded on, and I think the overall economy and crime rates are better when their involved; 
393245	they are tougher on crime. They want the states to govern more than the federal govt/ae/no 
393531	I belive some of them are human beings woking from their heart, but I DK if they will be able to make a diference. 
393753	Gun control laws, the way they handle the economy/ae/spend more money on military/ae/take better care of Vets/ae/no. 
393794	i like the way they handle things they are more for the working class people/ao/no 
394483	They seem to be for individaul freedoms and that would be business prosperity, I notice their focus more than the democrats /AE/ No 
394739	Small government, not getting involved with the individual's life. 
394872	i believe some of their member are good, honosty, hard working representative / ae/ i appreciate their values even they do not agree with my / ae/ i believe some of their parites believe in democracy so i can dismiss the entire republican party to be Trump faviourable and belives in Trumps values / ae/ no 
395024	conservative values

395139	More for the American people getting ahead.
