V240001	V241172 - PRE: What does R dislike about the Democratic party [text]
140001	way to radical for me in every way for me on every topic!
140003	Not wielding their power effectively
140005	live birth murder, border security, economy, illegals receiving benefits, tax payer trans surgeries
140014	Lack of transparency and chaos
140016	immagration, crime, cost of living
140017	lack of movement on immigration.
140018	sometimes they can be too liberal and spend irresponsibly
140021	The free handouts are decimating USA based industry, both large and small companies. Why go to work if you can sit at home and collect free handouts.
140023	General spinelessness and kowtowing to corporate interests, the military-industrial complex, and genociders, but honestly, this is not the focus of my political attention at the moment so it is tough to fully answer this question. Ask me after the election.
140028	Hypocrisy. They complain about things and then turn around and do the same thing.
140029	Shifting too far left of center
140032	The existence of a political party in any form supposes they are somehow important. The government should not exist at all outside of a very narrow band of duties and should not appear or be held up as an authority worthy of a human beings attention or resources.
140033	some social programs too generous, welfare system should be adjusted to account for eligible workers, we need tighter border restrictions, and student loan forgiveness too generous and not fair for those who paid off their loans at expense of delaying starting a family or buying a home
140034	immigartion policies are horrendous, soft on crime, terrible economic policy
140035	the extreme left
140038	Inept at winning elections, passing policy, and at communicating with their base. Interested in preserving USA hegemony and will use military resources to do so. Won't do enough to curb major issues in american politics stemming from current campaign finance structures and laws around lobbying. Won't do enough economically to lessen growing weath inequity.
140040	[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]They seem to hate this country, and the principles it was founded on.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]

140050	Sometimes they focus too much on a particular voting block or issue, to the detriment of other equally or more deserving groups within the party.

140055	I would like abortion to have some limits. Not to be able to use abortion as a form of birth control.
140056	immigration policy is bad, sometimes bends too much to the disastrous far left, can be misguided even if well intentioned

140060	the follow through can be lacking. they say they want pro choice and that they care about the environment but then let bit pharmaceutical companies and corporations buy their opinion
140061	the official policy toward the Palestinien issue.
140062	Listening to lobbyists, large corporations, and big pharma companies AT ALL. They shouldn’t even entertain these companies and lobbyisis. They should just do what they know is right.
140063	Immigration policies like open border
140065	can be sometimes too liberal.
140066	It is not strong enough against gun ownership and is not as anti-religion as I would like.
140067	Too beholden to corporate interests. Not willing enough to play hard ball, they compromise before they need to.
140070	Giving out too much money. Also allowing too much immigration.
140073	Their only concern is Donald Trump not getting into office again. I've heard nothing about what they will do to help this country, they are more interested in tearing it down.
140076	Until quite recently, their inability to fix the damn border. They did go along with the recent bill but Trump killed it. I realize we need unskilled labor to do the jobs Americans won't do, both parties need unskilled labor for nursing homes and to work in the barns of diary farms etc, clean the tiolets in Las Vegas, pick the lettuce in Calif, but we should be able to monitor who is coming in I prefer to see families rather than hordes of single men.

140116	They are corrupt, will do anything to win and election. They are soft on crime, soft on the border, economic policies are socialist.
140117	I feel like the democratic party wants better for the country, but I also feel that they withhold parts of the truth, and they also need to toughen up!
140119	Support for open borders, allowing criminals, terrorists and drugs to pour across our border, lack of support for law enforcement and our military, their support for candidates who are not up to the job (Biden and Harris), support for an unbalanced legal system, support for environmental issues that unfairly penalize U.

140155	just too liberal. They want to take care of everyone at my expense. the elderly and veterans are the ones we should be taking care of. Not young people, who chose to live in their parent's basement and chose to work part-time. Nor should we be footing the bill for immigrants.
140156	policies, their disdain for the country as ot was intended

140264	1) Policies the Democratic Party have put forward in recent times have shown to create discontent. [CHAR(10)]These policies include, immigration, voting integrity, censoring of social media, lawfare tactics against opponents, blatant intolerance of opposing American viewpoints, and the inability to follow general democratic practices for choosing candidates for the highest of offices.
140267	Too liberal, as long as it makes a person happy it’s ok whether it’s moral or not. All for the killing of babies via abortions.
140268	This Party has LOST its way. it is TOO WOKE, Too Divisive, works to Promote division in America, when they should focus on Issues that Help this Great Country.

They work for Satan!
140290	too many hand outs to illegal immigrants [CHAR(10)]major mishandling of tax payer money
140291	Not doing enough for environmental issues. Not addressing them, not enforcing and not working on the problems. What is being done and talked about by the democratic party and those politicians is extremely too little and too late. The problems going on socially and economically are egregious, but not existential, like that of the current environmental problems, which if not addressed immediately and drastically, will cause increased social, economical, political problems and make the world a very dangerous and possibly uninhabitable place for all if not most people.
140293	Immigration should be reformed a bit.
140294	using political system as warfare
140299	Their values are far from what I agree with. They are unable to work well with other parties or people who don't have the same ideas and opinions as them.
140300	too much support on illegals, not closing the border, giving free money to NONcitizens. not supporting police. not holding people accountable for stealing and burning cities down. not getting the hostages in Israel out. not standing up to radical islamists or other terror groups
140301	there's stance on abortion is disgusting, their stance on critical race Theory and gender Theory, their stance on allowing men to compete in women's sports, their immigration policies, College bailouts, how most of the democratic party hates Israel insides with Hamas, how they demonized capitalism in businesses even though they reap the benefits of all of those, the forcing of our kids and keeping them out of school, not following the science when they claim to, forcing vaccinations on people that had natural immunity from a disease, the teacher unions, taxes, and the jailing of Christians for just praying and how weak the current Democratic party has made us look in front of all the other countries in the world.
140304	I feel like the Democratic Party is wanting to support everyone at the expense of American taxpayers, and in spite of the fact that our country is extreme debt. I feel like the Democratic Party wants to force beliefs on the American people (force comfort with being in private areas with others of the same sex even if they claim a different gender; I feel like everyone is entitled to filling safe, especially in private areas). I feel like the Democratic Party wants to hold people in poverty by not encouraging a work ethic rather than encouraging people to work hard and earn their own way
140306	They should have worked harder to protect voting rights when they had the chance. They often don't do as much for people of color as they talk like they will. They don't work across the aisle as much as they should (maybe it's impossible at this time). They should have paid more attention to folks in the middle of the country that are suffering economically because of shifting jobs.
140309	The economy, health insurance, medicare, immigration and the way the green energy is handled
140311	They could do a better job of promoting their values. The republicans have spent 20+ years focusing on gaining power at the state levels. They had a stragety & it worked. Look at the Supreme Court. The democrates never seem to have the cohesiveness and ability to stay on point that the republicans have. Dems seem to lack the leadership for long-term stragety.
140312	they are the party of victims, it’s always someone else’s fault for their position in life.
140313	SK

140353	They shut down free speech, increase national debt, allow crime, terrorists, drugs and too many people in our country unvetted and for tax payers to support. Give too much money to foreign countries, have a corrupt DOJ, allow poor education and abortion after 8 weeks.
140356	Stance on crime
140359	Far left agenda that some of them push, taking more taxes to make government even bigger, slew of regulations that hurt small businesses, farmers and other industries. They are moving our country to socialism and we cannot allow that to happen. Providing for illegal aliens, housing, food, phones, school etc. It's overwhelming the system.

140362	not for traditional family values, trying to take parents rights away

140377	Fragmentation within the party, passivity when it comes to understanding disillusioned and blue collar voters, not having a good reach or strategy when it comes to rust belt states.
140379	spend to much, raise taxes and make living unaffordable
140381	The democrats dictate how people should feel, think, behave, and live. They're totally clueless what people really want or need. They're idea of freedom" is being just free enough to get a job, pay taxes, and blindly follow and fund their next cockamamie scheme that usually ends in disaster, mainly for the people, and ends up enriching the ones at the top, which is typical of every socialist regime in the world."
140385	They lack leadership and the ability to work across the aisle.
140386	big government, untruthful,
140388	Sometimes they don't control their off the wall reps in actions and words[CHAR(10)]Need to be stronger
140389	They always want to raise taxes and are easily pushed around by the government or foreign nations.

140405	they act like wealth for anyone but themselves is a bad thing, they like spending other peoples money, they seem to think they need to try and solve every problem in the world
140408	too much focus on selfish things like identity groups and taking away from those who work hard to give it to the lazy.
140414	They tell too many lies and try to take credit for what someone else does or says. Just look at what they have done to the economy and national debt. Voter fraud in the last presidential election. Standing behind Joe Biden and lying about his health when you can tell he has dementia by just looking at him and letting someone else run the president office and making a puppet out of him. That's nothing less than adult abuse. All of them should be charged for abuse.

140434	They used to support education more than they do now. We need to get back to the basics again, especially teaching cursive writing again!
140437	Subversive, detrimental policies that masquerade as 'feel-good' common sense" when in reality they strip Americans of our rights and freedoms; public relations personnel who are skilled at double-talk and deniability; no clear agenda other than consolidating and maintaining political power."
140439	the debt we have [CHAR(10)]crime is a mess
140440	Too liberal. I don't agree with their stand on abortion, border policies, or the rampant crime in this country, especially in democrat lead cities.
140443	leftist big government policies. lack of support for international allys. Socialist viewpoints on health care and abortion which is ruining the family unit.

140465	messaging has been weak
140466	everything, there policies
140467	In both parties, there is a central cadre of bureaucratic professionals who appear to be insulated from the realities of American Life. They are there to raise funds for X, Y or Z candidate and the Party... and for their own perpetual salary. They laud the work of the folks on the street whooping up the vote but, in the end, don't care past the election. Careerist is an ugly term, but appropriate. I'm hopeful with Walz joining the ticket.
140471	pro choice, no border control, anti guns, pro gender choice.
140472	just bad policies and try to push things on is hard working citizens. Our economy is terrible and I've lost money during the Bidenomics.

140476	Position on gender issues, economics, pretending to be for the people when their governance borders on fascism with all the executive order, partisan DOJ and FBI.

Their messaging is insulting - it seems they believe that if they say something often enough it makes it true, which it doesn't. Both parties are guilty of this, but the democratic party has done a more thorough job of hijacking the news so that we don't get news - we just get opinions from people who think they should/can/deserve to tell us how to think.

141009	Financial ties with war criminals like the Israeli government. Immigration detention and deportation.
141011	Open border. economy, most liberal party in many years. The actions by the party and media have pushed me so far right, i will not vote for anyone in that party nor trust the media again. I was a registered democrats for about 30 yeas of my life, changed to independent and then to a central republican. I am so far right now that the only left I can see is how I shoot my shotgun. My wife, daughters and grandchildren are republicans. They liberals of this nation have a lot of work to do, hope not in my lifetime.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]
141016	I don't like the way they steered Democrats away from Bernie Sanders and Carvelle won't shut up.
141018	Too much emphasis on putting people into categories (first woman to do this, first black such and such, etc) rather than just treating us as people. Focuses on letting everyone do their own thing (gay sex, changing genders) rather than having a strong moral foundation and recognizing that some things are black and white and not everything is for the individual to decide what is right.
141021	Wide open borders, printing and borrowing money we don’t have
141023	too liberal, too woke, too high taxes, terrible border control
141024	They appear to want to have more government oversight with all American’s more big government
141026	Too much negativity.
141027	allowing illegal immigrants into this country.
141028	Biden supports China
141029	In general, they aren't great with messaging, making it clear how laws they've passed and actions they've taken are making people and our country better off.
141031	Lack of focus. More attention on trans rights and diversity than on the issues that affect Americans the most.
141032	they have lost there way,and are destroying our country especically with allowing immigrants into our country without vetting them. allowing statues that are an importanrt part of our history .allowing our cities to be burned when they dont get there way. failure to jail those that destroy individuals property.
141033	idea that people should get things they don't have to earn
141034	abortions, LGBT, undocumented immigrants.
141035	foreign policies and conflicts
141038	Less conservative
141039	scared of replublicans. won't stand up to them and follow thru on calling them out.
141040	Inmigración, inseguridad
141042	Their tax policies don’t really reflect my fiscal priorities.
141043	The Democratic Party spends too much money.
141045	socialism has never worked in any country.
141047	Sometimes too much infighting allows republicans to win
141049	the far left and infighting [CHAR(10)]need to work together more
141051	I Feel they are the cause of most of the hate that is in the nation at this time. Everyone is a racist, or something in their eyes. and they and the media should be Ashamed of themself.
141055	foreign policy towards Palestine is too easy on Israel, no marijuana legalization, no universal support for single payer healthcare
141056	to me, the Democrats seem to be way more aggressive and loud and in your face it seems like they try to strong arm you into submitting to believing the way they do.
141059	abortion, border, crime, economy issues
141060	Far too extreme and soft
141061	They really need to get their act together.
141062	The things in particular that I do not like about the democratic party are energy policy, foreign policy, inflation, abortion party, no control over the border, lack of support law enforcement which leads to massive crime.
141063	They do not know how to use power when they have it!
141064	At least until recently they didn't seem to have a direction and just would always be on defensive on policies. Now they are more offensive and it is refreshing.
141065	They are a losing party and dishonest about many things.
141067	Everything. This party wants to do nothing but tear apart our country and make everybody dependent on the system.
141070	having illegal Mexican crossing the border
141071	They need to be more assertive in their beliefs. I think many politicians on both sides are focused on keeping their seats rather than helping the country succeed.
141075	Transgender Operations Shouldn't Be Performed Or Covered By Medical Bc One Wearing A Mask Should Not Be Supported...
141077	Seems like they party is too willing to let the far, far left speak for them and polarize everything. Spends money like it will never be accounted for. Seems like they are tone-def and do not realize that everyone in this country does not live on one of the coasts. You would think a reality check should have happened to them when Trump beat Clinton. She was so unpopular that she let that idiot beat her, yet she still walks around like a celebrity. Seems like the party thinks too highly of themselves.
141078	Abortion, they are baby killers
141080	Pushing Bernie out. elitism and not listening to the working class but letting those with money make big party decisions. not doing enough for climate change. Too much money in politics.
141082	It seems to me that they have swung so far left that they aren't even on the spectrum of reasonable anymore. Males in female sports. Exaltation of LGBTQAIP+-&@# as if gender is the new final frontier. Insane and ridiculous approaches to education and overt censorship of any speech that makes them look like the certifiable lunatics they've become. Democrats used to be the party of caring and reason, the party of the little guy. Now, they're becoming monsters.
141083	WOKE, facists, Obama-loving Muslim[CHAR(10)]extremist lovers.
141084	extremes of ideas, when democrats yell that other opinions are wrong and cannot voice opinions
141085	Everything.Bad policies concerning the border... crime...being energy dependent...foreign policy.......
141086	no Presidential candidates I feel strongly for; not doing more for regular Palestinians; not taking stronger stance against Israeli government; unable to figure out a solution for the southern border crisis; seems to be more reactive than proactive
141087	from my view it's weaker fundamentally
141088	No policies and very worried about our country if Democratic party wins. Immigration is my biggest concern.
141089	The way the handling of the country
141093	Nancy Pelosi she cheated on her tax returns. She cheated when she knew about selling her stocks when they was for she wouldn’t lose any money
141094	They don't always stand their ground.
141097	open border to many gives to those who enter our country illegal
141098	The Democratic Party needs to articulate more strongly how it will reform the Supreme Court.
141099	Nominating candidates that don't resonate with people.
141100	seeming lack of trying to understand why 46% of the country feels abandoned, no attempt to control illegal border crossings, strategic lack of concern the US has no domestic commercial ship building industry and limited military capability, limited military support to Ukraine
141101	government giveaways to gain votes, implementing imormal lifestyles which will in time destroy our country, teaching people how to be helpless letting the government take care of them.
141105	SK
141106	They sometimes have other motives once they get in office.
141108	Their inconsistent messaging and disconnect from the general populous
141110	They appear to be pro socialists.
141111	THERE HATE FOR AMERICA AND OUR CONSTITUTION .
141112	pro abortion, careless or no immigration handling, NO modal sense
141113	handling debt and our economy
141117	Democrat party now is not the decent Democrat of JFK in the past. Now communist Democrats follow globalists, communist China, deep state with Obama to destroy America. Democrats always lie with no shame, no morality and no patriotism. They open border to take over 15 million illegal strangers in to burden American citizens and replacing white people. Obama and democrats divided America with racist propaganda and Trump hate. Most Democrat lawmakers and voters are OK with STOLEN Election, extreme abortion, government dependence, inflation, crime increase in blue cities, sexual garbage books in children libraries, and worst, they accepted to be brainwashed by the DNC propaganda with evil actions and oppression to patriots and Jan 6 protestors who are real political prisoners at DC.
141122	power at any cost
141128	Mostly their stance on abortion, immigration/open borders, allowing socialistic agenda by some far-left democrats to cause issues in the party.
141129	wokeness[CHAR(10)]anti family[CHAR(10)]anti American pride [CHAR(10)]anti white [CHAR(10)]anti male [CHAR(10)]pro china [CHAR(10)]illegals are a problem [CHAR(10)]most are idiots [CHAR(10)]they are weak
141130	almost everything they are doing,( from the economy , rents and mortgages , foreign policies , the crime rate , etc ) is to hurt this country , in my opinion .
141131	Much too liberal and want to change our country into socialism and they spent too much money on wasteful programs.
141132	They have tried to divide the nation referring to black and white issues in particular.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]They have lied about issues like the Russia gate deal and turning the FBI, CIA and major news networks into political weapons. Also I do not like all the legal harassing of people who disagree with them or their policies like Elon Musk and Trump.
141138	teaching children about inappropriate sexual content! open borders! spending my tax dollars frivolously! lying about everything! not serving we the people but themselves! dishonoring God at every turn! disarming police! crippling ICE! making themselves rich at our expense!
141139	I don't like how that think more liberally than conservatively.
141140	sometimes they are too weak
141141	too far left, too much love for power and not the people’s interest
141142	everything. they lie about everything
141143	Stronger on immigration laws and border entry.
141144	Too one-sided. They should listen to the Republicans and Independents.
141150	Too soft on crime.
141152	They are often too weak willed. MAGAs are brash and confident (though often wrong), the Dems need some of that higher-energy determination. More Liz Warren!
141154	immigration status or lack there of
141155	they are for the people
141157	Their energy policy especially with them wanting eliminate fossil fuels. I'm all for the development of different alternative renewable forms of energy, but not the so ridiculously trying to eliminate existing and cheaper forms of energy. Their deficit spending has created inflation and they can't just keep trying to tax the rich thinking that will solve the problems and finances of problems.
141158	The Democratic Party sometimes lets its mission to serve the smallest minorities get in the way of doing what is best for the most people. An example is the push for trans rights--this is an important consideration, but maybe more important is to not let the vast amounts of working class folks in hard-hit areas feel left behind. This ends up hurting the Democratic Party, as white working-class people have left the Democaratic party in droves, in favor of the MAGA movement, which promises them their recompense, often at the expense of immigrants and minorities.
141159	Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
141160	everthing that they do
141162	sometimes they take a too liberal approach
141165	They will Lie, Cheat or Steal for power money or control. Giving personal or party gains over the good of the country.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]
141167	sometimes their willingness to help is good, but people still need to help themselves at the same time
141169	basically everything
141170	Blame Trump and Republican party for all the country's problems ( imigration/ economy) while they have been in the White house for the past 4 years and haven't solved the issues; I don't care for their encouraging transgender movement and Kamala is proud she's made the cost of transgender surgery available to prison inmates[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]
141171	letting JB continue as long as he has.
141172	That it is very liberal
141173	Spend, Spend,Spend with our money.
141175	The two party system in general is flawed. Nobody is 100% right.
141176	THEIR POLICIES ARE BASED ON THE DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA--JUST LOOK AT THE [CHAR(10)]BORDER---THE INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS IS INTENTIONAL
141178	Lack of a system to process immigrants. Their extreme position on abortion and lack of any concern or tolerance of people who are concerned about the unborn child.
141180	I think we should all be equal, that doesn’t mean someone gets more help because of their race or who they love. that’s unequal.
141183	Sometimes they focus on idiotic things like lgbtq rights when there are real problems that need to be dealt with first.
141184	they have a horrible foreign policy and they push transgender on everyone they make a mockery of our country having people twerk at the White House I am against everything they have done
141186	With democratic registration their candidates should never lose. I see this as lacking the ability to completely energize their voters.
141192	Democratic Party has allowed republicans to out campaign them. Democrats need to be really good at shutting down the misinformation. Democrats are the majority but the system has been gerrymandered unfairly and that needs to change if we ever want to push the right policies forward instead of being in a stalemate passing policies and then later having them voted out.
141193	They are not strong enough, and don’t brag enough.
141194	Open borders, war against fossil fuels, wasteful spending. Focusing too much on race, sex gender instead of qualifications.
141195	Some extremists in the party but not the party in general
141196	the blurred line between right and wrong acts. Especially when it come to religious morality.
141197	more taxes for my bracket
141200	for hard working Americans. pro American dream. pro life. for smaller government.
141205	Poor immigration policy[CHAR(10)]Poor economic policy[CHAR(10)]Too many policy differences within the party.[CHAR(10)]
141208	They spending is out of control!
141209	Giving benefits to illegal immigrants when they should be helping American citizens more.
141210	promotion of the famous and rich instead of trying to make middle and low income life livable.
141212	many are bought and paid for on both sides
141217	Lack of push/drive. Lack of Party candidates.
141218	Untruthful with the American people.
141221	Letting all that won’t come in our country with out verification
141225	I think the party is all about controlling the American people instead of working on our behalf and I believe that they're more interested in power than compromise. The way Joe Biden has been exploited is stitching and disheartening, and their choice to have Kamala as a presidential nominee when they've even admitted that she's a train wreck of a vp is astounding to me. At least choose somebody competent.
141228	Not as practical as it needs to be sometimes. But also does not boldly put forth a vision for the future as I would like.
141230	Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar are overt antisemites and should be condemned and disciplined by the party.
141233	Too liberal
141234	Inability to affect change and lack of cohesion
141235	Their unwillingness to accept any other ideas that don’t agree with theirs
141237	not progressive enough, in my opinion. and largely full of cowards
141239	everything they now stand for
141240	I no longer trust the democrat party. Feels very much like they have their own agenda and they dont stand as strongly by their ideology as they did prior. Now it is about who they can get financial support from and the democrat candidates feel like puppets to get these agendas completed.
141241	the party is too left leaning and liberal.
141243	The democrats only care about gays, abortion and rich tech people. Plus they lied about Biden having dementia.
141244	they are too relaxed on immigration. Too focused on abortion. Too relaxed with foreign policy.
141247	liberal and socialist agenda
141248	I my opinion, the Democratic Party has been captured by the globalists who are pushing for a socialist one world order.
141253	Too much spending.
141260	They sometimes form blocs for election purposes only. In reality, they have kept unfavorable candidates in office, just to keep their majority!
141261	Marked 'yes' when it was supposed to be 'no'.
141262	Everything related to gender politics and DEI. Democrats also do not work to influence/conteract the current perceptions the right is pushing on them. Democrats need to take back patriotism and American Pride and LEADERSHIP.
141264	They don't have the balls to stand up for their beliefs. The Blue Dog Democrats of old sure did. I didn't always agree but it was clear where they stood.
141265	Get with it! These past 30 years of obstructionism have left behind belated laws, witness immigration law, military budget, job training subsidy, drug laws, etc and if anything is to be done it’s gotta be the Dems because Republicans care about rich donors and little else.
141266	The Democratic National Committee, I believe, has been elitist, overbearing and slick in the way it tries to control the party.
141267	I think they generally see government, and especially the federal government as the primary solution to problems.
141269	Agree to abortions - allow abortions at birth. The border was never a high priority. Cutting the has been a disaster. Leaving soldiers, locals who helped our country, behind when the military was pulled out was criminal! Leaving millions of dollars of our military equipment behind to be used by any an all criminal activity was totally unacceptable!
141270	more government
141271	Too liberal and control the news media
141274	Too liberal. They are not logically looking at the end of carbon engines and how electric vehicles will also negatively impact the environment. Also going too far on welfare and handouts. Refusal to deal with border issues until it is election time.
141275	they seem to can't get anything done.
141276	They are liars, manipulators of the media, they are using scare tactics and everything bad they say about Trump is basically a reflection of them
141281	abortion policy
141286	The education system needs a revamp that is teacher driven not test driven. stop passing kids that are not grade level competent, university tuition is ridiculous promote the trades more, revamp the welfare system to incentivize those living at or below poverty level. Stop adding to defense without adding to all other areas. Without an educated population we are nothing.
141288	Even though they seem to care about all levels of society , they sometimes seem guilty of giving it all away..
141291	Recent candidates
141295	The rhetoric on the far left of the party has gotten louder and more antidemocratic. Understandable this is in reaction to the rhetoric given voice on the other side.
141300	They can be too timid. It seems like they get caught off guard by the Republican nastiness too often, because they play by the rules and the Republicans don't.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]
141301	Immigration issues, poor economy, high interest rates, giving too much money overseas, funding too many social programs for minorities.
141302	The Democratic Party used to be known for the working class of America. Anyone who still believes this or is standing with this party because of their parents being democrats, always voting straight dem ticket is being fooled. Since 2020 and our 2020 leadership, there has been a turn that is anti-America - what we stand for, have stood for. It seems the dems are more about being popular with voters (cancelling student loans - how stupid), not following our Immigration policy; instead, giving sanctuary to any one coming in - even cartels, traffickers - removing any 'bar' of check and balance which is how our US government was established - a system of checks and balances. Too many obvious things done in this term by dems - including what seems to be buying the media. Burying Hunter Biden's illegal and untruthful activities, along with Pres. Biden's (family in bed with China and filling their bank accounts deceptively). Everyone must open their eyes and get real by knowing what you value and voting your values. I honestly believe past performance is a stronger indicator of future performance - it's not a golden rule or fact; but it's more than marketing or flat-out untruth.
141303	Get better candidates that can relate to us common folk.
141306	Can't seem to get along with the Republicans
141307	They kill babies and allow illegalimmigrants with convicts in.
141312	I feel like sometimes the Democrats are just too nice!
141313	Immigration policies
141316	When they push their own moral values on others
141317	That this party also takes handouts that make them lean a certain way. Based on what they preach, you would think they would actually represent the people vs. corporations.
141322	woke agenda. policies revolve around liberal policies or whoever they are pandering too
141324	Too much infighting with the fringe of the party, not enough effort to counter the efforts of the right to infringe on voting rights.
141325	Not great political fighters
141326	the candidates
141328	don't care about the middle class. We can't afford food, gas, everything is sooooo expensive, you need 2 or 3 jobs to exist
141330	Most of their social policies.
141334	Support of same sex marriages and transgenders competing in sports.
141335	Border policies
141338	Sometimes the extremist go too far and give the Dem party a bad name.
141340	Nitpicky, unable to bend for compromise, budget issues, too much foreign aid
141341	They tend to be less fiscally conservative.
141342	slow to move on important issues
141343	overall tired of old people making decisions and playing these political games
141344	lack of control of the border
141348	I don't agree with the liberal extremism in the party, especially around issues like children's trans rights, pro Hamas rhetoric, and some immigration policy
141349	they overcompensate. also, they spend to much.
141350	they are looking for more government involvement. like a said in the other answer, government waste money the more the get involved.
141353	they need to be stronger with their stats sometimes you have to fight fire with fire
141354	There are certain agendas that I don't particularly agree with. I know the Dem party drives for inclusion of all things - but, my beliefs are not in alignment with the effects of the agendas they are pushing for. Ex. allowing puberty blockers and gender transition for young children. If we won't allow children to take drugs, drink alcohol, or even sign up on their own to go to a public jumpie house (must have adult waiver), why would we allow them to make life altering decisions about their body when they are scientifically proven to not be able to make sound decisions based on an underdeveloped prefontal cortex ( age 25 I believe).
141355	Open border policy, electric car policy, energy policies, gun control policies, foreign affairs policies. I think America is seen as weak and vulnerable under Biden and Harris
141358	Giving away too much money
141359	They are taking things way too far, way past anything within reason.
141362	Leaning heavily toward a Socialist government
141363	Immigration policy
141366	are leftists or progressives. do not like what they stand for i.e. poor policies regarding economy, immigration and border. Do not their policy of downsizing the police
141368	I believe both political parties are flawed in some ways. I think the Democratic Party can still be bought and sold to the highest bidder when given the chance.
141369	list is too long. Their lack of seriousness about the border and obvious abuses of the asylum policy. Their authoritarian approach to covid policies. Their annoying habit of reading Trump into literally everything (which allows them to not actually address anything), and the media fawning and cover they provide them. And their willingness to walk us into a potential nuclear conflict with Russia.
141370	Spending money right and left without financially backed; have wasted the last 4 years under Biden/Harris; they stole the election from Trump in 2016; the president and vice president are puppets on a string being handled by Democratic elite
141374	Fiscal responsibility is not a strong suit, some policy positions held by the far left are too extreme in my opinion
141375	Their relentless increases in taxes and fees on any level of government where they have power has to stop.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Their ridiculous spending, especially on pet projects, has to stop.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]They have gone much too far to the left. This isn't the party of JFK, or even Bill Clinton.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Their border policy is horrendous.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Their foreign policy is atrocious.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]They are the primary reason inflation is through the roof with their out-of-control spending.
141376	They have not been doing a good job building up and preparing new candidates for future roles. They are relying on name recognition and not promoting the younger talent sufficiently.
141377	Some cultural issues related to gender, unlimited restrictions on abortion, left wing embracing of Hamas & anti-Jewish rhetoric.
141378	The Democratic party has shown they cannot be trusted to lead America Constitutionally.
141379	everything that there doing is destroying this country
141381	Helped lie us into iraq..voted for the high treason patriot act...can care less about our education system
141384	Sometimes the party seems too splintered.
141385	sometimes to diplomatic
141386	again, they philosophy on economic policy, intolerance to negotiate, forgiving student loan debt forcing retirees to pay and policy on border control.
141387	The Democratic Party appears to be underrepresented.
141388	Sometimes it acts too woke. Sometimes it goes too far with cancel culture. It needs to be more welcoming to moderates (Manchin, Tester, Casey) and center-leaning Republicans who have a hard time feeling at home in the Republican party perhaps Sens. Collins, ME and Murkowski, AK; like Gov. Kelly, KS and Sen. King, ME). I don't like that it has on occasion kowtowed to Anti-Semites when it comes to policies around Israel and the Palestinians.
141391	Literally everything single thing they stand for. Their moral issues, economic policy, dishonesty regarding elections, the news networks protecting them, censorship, etc.
141392	they represent the average person
141396	All the bickering back and forth
141398	they knew Joe biden was mentally/physically unfit to be the current president let alone the next president months before they finally made the decision to remove him from the ballot. the fact it took him embarrassing himself and the party on national TV for them to finally do the right thing was shameful. and just assuming democrats wanted Kamala as the replacement candidate without any voting process felt un-American
141399	They support Israel in genocide.
141400	they lie and don’t keep their promises
141401	spineless worthless liars
141402	they need to fight a little harder sometimes. they are too laxed.
141403	stances on crime, immigration, abortion, and socialism
141404	Horrible policy
141405	I have lived under socialism and Democrat party is heading more and more in that direction. I do not like the woke culture and the cancel culture. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]
141407	The open border policy is terrible. Millions of illegals that they let come here that we don't know who they are, and this current administration is giving them free housing, free healthcare, free meals and debit cards. They put us last
141410	They hate our constitution. They hate freedom, liberty, and justice. They have ruined our schools. The scores are embarrassing. We have spent a ridiculous amount of money for each student and get nothing in return. They need to stick with reading, writing, English, math. It is up to the parents to teach about sex. They treat parents like the enemy and act as if the government owns their children. It is evil. It is bizarre.
141411	socialist agenda
141414	finance. This nation will lose its shirt to the Chinese"
141415	Forced Biden to step aside
141417	The lack of younger politicians almost created a crisis in this critical election.
141419	soft on crime , want to kill babies. open border.
141421	their lack of fight for abortion policy
141423	religious beliefs
141425	they could have more trust in each other to better this country
141426	abortion, illegal immigrants, corrupt, wnat to control the people
141427	They seem to undermine themselves by internal bickering at times, they need to be more proactive on the wage inequality, they need to move further on fixing our national infrastructure.
141428	extreme about issues
141430	left wing policies
141431	I believe that we should reward hard working Americans. I do not believe that any able bodied American should be allowed government handouts
141432	They support the killing of unborn babies. They seem to put ahead the human rights of illegal immigrants ahead of the human rights of American citizens. Their green policies are not always green and by not using our natural resources they are killing our economy.
141435	immigration policy, woke agenda, laundering money through Ukraine war
141438	the open boarders
141440	I think it was absolute social suicide to force Hillary to be the candidate in 2016 even when Bernie had the votes and it was clear that Bernie was the candidate who could beat Donald Trump. clearly, the DNC does not and is not focused on the daily life of Americans and what Americans actually want. I can understand that they are a political entity and they are fighting the RNC, which is very fake and just about clout so I can see why that’s the way that they angle their fight against them, but at the same time they have completely ruined or trust in the DNC and to be honest our main fault of why we have to deal with Trump at all in this election. as someone who is transgender and was a woman for 22 years of their life, I can definitely understand the great importance of Hillary Clinton being the first woman president, I know that she’s gone through a lot in her life, and I know that she’s held everything together this entire time because she wanted to be one day president and other high offices in the government. However, her personal story does not mean that everyone else has to suffer under Trump because she needs to try to be president. That was incredibly, selfish of her to not look at the numbers and not gracefully give her spot to Bernie Sanders. I would argue having a Jewish president would be historically just as ground breaking as having a woman president. The fact that she did not step aside and allow that to happen at the time that it was supposed to happen is quite inappropriate. i’m extremely tired of the bush, dynasty and Clinton dynasty, and what that means in a larger viewpoint of specific families holding so much power in our government and our daily lives. Also don’t particularly trust Democrats, as they just barely got on board with marriage equality, gender identity, transgender rights, and a real fight against police and state brutality against people in minority identity, especially people of color. It seems like historically it’s always been up to social justice activist to retain freedom and independence in this country and what do you know it’s up to us yet again.

141443	the push toward socialism and the outlandish rhetoric forced down our throats. also the fact that they have the mainstream media spewing the same

141461	I always feel that they're bringing a knife to a gun fight when they go up against This Maga movement. I don't like how strongly anti Israel the far left is and I wish they had the necessary ruthlessness to keep our country out of the hands of Donald Trump and his Maga movement.

141469	They also have too far reaching laws for my taste in the wrong areas. Don't force citizens to recycle for example when you're going to allow 3M and Dupont to continue operation. The onus of the health of our earth is on our governments. Same goes for our health. I was not a fan of vaccine mandates which a lot of democrats supported. People should always maintain bodily autonomy. The democrats are also flat out terrible at politics. The way that Obama never filled Merick Garland into the Supreme Court for example was the gap that pushed Amy Barrett in.
141470	Made up of crooked and cheating people
141471	Woke culture. Everything from pronoun uses, to anti-racism that is in fact reverse-racism. As humans were somewhat tribal and, with that, hateful. Forcing beliefs on someone who may not agree, but telling them they have to, is counterproductive. Happens on both sides and deepens the divide.

141489	The spending needs to be reviewed.
141490	They need to be more moderate.
141491	I feel in the last three and a half years, very little progress has been made with securing our borders and finding an honorable and safe method to address immigration. While recent actions by President Biden were designed to help, he waited entirely too long and many big cities have been suffering under growing numbers of migrants. I also wish President Biden could have been convinced to step aside much earlier to avoid all the last minute chaos.
141496	not well organized, dont have specific and concise narratives
141497	The abortion issue bothers me because we only hear a blanket coverage of a law that has been voted in place...there are exceptions and each case needs to be on an individual basis. People voted in office are not doctors and most have no idea of an individual case.[CHAR(10)]

141554	Oftentimes, prior to the rallying behind Harris/Walz, there has been a lack of organization and a cohesive effort within the party, whereas the Republican party has this giant oaf to rally behind and bootlick constantly, which for some reason has worked in the past.

141591	I’m not sure how I’m going to be able to afford the future they have planned. With the way the economy has been going under Biden, I’m already at my financial limits. They aren’t raising the wages for workers to livable earnings, so I’m not sure where else they expect the American people to get the money from to pay for the programs needed to help everyone they promise. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I also do not support how they have been treating the war with Israel/Palestine, and the money they are using to continue to fuel the innocent lives being lost there.

Then news/social media etc. then takes a hold of it and gives .5% of the population all the attention while others that represent more people are left with .5% of the attention.
141605	they need to support Israel and Ukraine more. we can not let Bullies like Putin and terrorist like Hamas and hezbula push innocent people around

141639	lot of policy focused on “hey, at least we’re not the GOP” instead of real changes for citizens
141640	They are too liberal... anything goes no matter how demonic. This transgender stuff is crap. God does not make mistakes. God decides the sex of a person and kids don't know what they want for supper, much less if they want to be a boy or a girl later in life. It's demonic activity in the Democratic God=less party.

141675	We tend to take a long time to converge to a majority opinion on any issue. But that may be a good thing as this is a Democracy. But I'm someone who can take the facts and make up my mind fairly quickly. Waiting for the rest of the party to catch up can be frustrating at times.
141678	Their Abortion stance, illegal immigration views, careless spending, covering up for each other, not looking at the overall larger impact of their decisions, wanting to pay student debt, their not handling crime.
141682	they need to be more into the young vote social media is a start
141683	no moral values what so ever
141684	full of communist Marxist power hungry tyrannical freedom hating anti-American pricks
141686	Lying, Tax increases, giving our money to foreign countries
141687	It seems to me that the Democratic Party frequently acts as if it is on the defensive--wanting to take the high ground and uncomfortable about telling the American people the stark truth about the challenges that face this country. In their desire to be inclusive, they have to manage many factions and opinions. They have a hard time offering a coherent message sometimes.[CHAR(10)]I also think they allow environmental issues to take a back seat to more pressing people problems.[CHAR(10)]I believe climate change is a true existential crisis that will impact millions of people around the globe and spread huge political instability. It's truly the biggest issue we face and we are running out of time to stem the changes that we will have no means to control. It is time to face it squarely.

141700	Biden and friends have completely ruined this country. it is like we went backwards in time. everything is in shambles.
141702	They talk a lot about helping the middle class. Just getting to middle class was a struggle. Keeping it is getting harder. All I see is handouts for the rich and the poor.
141703	They lean towards Socialism and are trying to DESTROY our Country!
141704	Priorities are mixed up and support spending on frivolous things.
141706	they are too worried about being “woke” then the country

141709	Nearly everyone of their policies but particularly their support of a woke" agenda."
141711	No definition or clarity on how they want to conduct the business of the country
141713	I just stated it a couple questions back, their stance on taxes and the economy over the last 4 years, immigration, healthcare policies.
141715	Way too liberal,leans too far to the left, too many crazy ideas.
141716	Everything from the last 4 years of Democrats in office. I also feel the media is very much one-sided when it comes to coverage between the two parties.
141718	support of lgbtqia
141720	Way too many HAND OUTS to NON AMERICANS. Don't mind a hand up, but hand outs, NO. Buying votes by eliminating student debt while our veterans are homeless is SHAMEFUL. How about eliminating all debts, my mortgage for example, I signed and agreed to the loan docs, just like students.
141723	They are weak and don't fight.
141725	I don't agree that illegal immigrants should be provided all the things that American citizens aren't even able to get like free healthcare, housing, food, etc. I understand they are fleeing horrible circumstances, and I don't know what the solution is, but we cannot continue to have open borders and absorb all these people when we can't even take care of our own homeless and poverty stricken citizens. I don't think there is any other country that allows entry of thousands like we do.
141729	I do not like their views on abortion, firearms, immigration, punishment to crimes. I don't like anything that they stand for.
141730	In their plan to continue the growth of people voting for their agenda, they have sacrificed our immigration laws and encouraged the illegal immigration of millions of people, the enormity of which is a liability to our support systems, and there has been a significant increase of in crime and heinous crimes.
141731	Everything. There is nothing to like about them.
141736	they are in power and driving the deficit up
141741	So much today, almost every policy or ideological track is tainted with or by ultra/far liberal or worst, progressivism. I hate Progressivism. I would like for the Progressives in the DEM party to really look at those nations, failed some of them like Venezuela, and ask if they would rather live there and even so take their relatives and loved ones with them.

141767	I am opposed to abortion, and the Democrat Party has positioned itself as the party of abortion rights.
141769	Too many taxes
141770	Weak on crime, inability to hold Republican law breakers accountable for their actions, sometimes they try to be too nice, weak immigration policy
141771	same thing they cannot or will not come to terms, for the people who are paying these outrageous taxes, it must be nice to make what they do per year, that's politics !!
141776	The Democratic party can sometimes feel a little too fueled by emotion, which although is good in aspects in practice and makes it very hard to have a logical discussion sometimes. The Democratic party has recently developed a negative view of if they can't prove a fact or situation they resort to for lack of better words bad tactics of retaliation.
141777	do not like an extreme liberal agenda
141778	They are garbage at message control. Also they appear to have very little willingness to engage in the sort of foreign policy that I think needs to be done, which is a bit more real politique than they are willing to accept.
141780	Everything They don't care about we the People
141785	Occasional failure to disavow the more extreme parts of the left who hyperfocus on identity politics or create progressive litmus tests that can interfere with winning in battleground areas.

141793	refusing to work jointly and amicably with other party for common good of our nation

141810	I don't believe in full-term abortion. And I support state rights regarding abortion. However, I do believe in abortion right for the woman to decide. Also, I don't believe in the way the Democrats are handling the border. There are too many people coming across that we don't know who they are

141873	Middle East foreign policy disasters, open border with Mexico allowing millions of illegal aliens into this country.
141874	The democrat party in America has been in change for many years, but of late has moved decidedly far left. I seems to be deep into identity politics, the woke agenda, sexualizing our young children, and even to supporting the inclusion of pornographic materials in the public-school libraries. Where I live we are more insulated from these hurtful ideologies, but the democrats fight for more and more liberalism in schools, even to the point of keeping secret from parents the way a child may be deciding to identify, male or female. The practices tear at the fabric of the family unit, the place where these issues, if they present themselves, should be dealt with. The schools should be focusing on math, language, and science knowledge and skills, not trying to fundamentally change who our children think they are sexually.

141902	socialism abortion border energy policy and Latvian issues
141903	The need for money to make a successful campaign, although the other party follows the same methodology.

141930	yes I do they don't mind doing what ever it takes to gain and control power and they believe that regular people are beneath them so they are elite and we are all meaningless slaves to them and they can just keep lying to us and we are to dumb to see it is strongly what they believe in they went from the Confederate party to the communist party
141931	su defensa a favor del aborto
141933	Sometimes policy decisions are made based on perception by a public that doesn't fully understand the issue. Decisions should be based more on data and cause & effect relationships. If those relationships are not evident to the public, resources should be allocated to helping people understand issues so that more educated decisions can be made. I'm not trying to imply that people are stupid, just that any one person cannot be an expert in everything. People need help overcoming biases. Education will promote that.
141934	My perception is that they want to fund all projects for all organizations and we don't have money to do that.
141935	policies; hypocrisy
141936	Trying to make the USA socialist.
141940	They cheat on elections

141967	border issues and immigration
141969	Terrible loss of control of border.
141973	I can’t stand big government. Everybody in the Democrat party wants to control you. I don’t like anything about them.
141976	CODIFY ROE V WADE. The response to the genocide occurring in Palestine. We need to stop financially banking Israel. Impose sanctions. Stop US citizens from being financially complicit in murder. Stop children dying in the classrooms because gun control is so weak. Stop pandering to the less educated and push for better EPA regulations. FIX THE TAX CODE THAT DJT PUSHED THROUGH THAT IS SLOWLY RUINING THE ECONOMY.
141978	a lot of talking , pretending to be better than others (smug)
141979	I find the Democratic party uses mis information & lies to the press & 90 % of the media keeps reporting it even though they know its not true.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Our political system is broken!
141980	Economic damage and increasing prices seem to be the result of their pursuit of environmental policies that, from my perspective are unlikely to actually make a positive impact on the environment. Said differently, their policies impose a price on citizens with little likelihood of a positive return for society. I also am opposed to their policy toward abortion.
141981	their stupidity around Republicans. Democrats seem to be somewhat gullible when attempting to make policy that is bipartisan.
141984	it’s basically two sides of the same coin with democrats and republicans now. the democrats in congress are not very progressive and not much changes.
141985	Extreme liberal views.
141987	policies are going way to left, discourage many from bettering themselves
141988	They are more out for themselves and do anything to make themselves richer

141992	They're not conservative
141994	I dont like the way they do things
141998	Too liberal and they want to fundamentally change the country.
141999	Politicians in general have no accountability. They seem to know it. All spin and skirting the law.
142000	They are beholden to the military industrial complex. They support the murder of human beings in the womb.
142001	everything…free handouts, immigration, abortion
142004	I dislike the collective cultism that exists within the Democrat Party, that doesn't allow for dissenting opinion within their ranks. I also dislike the rapid growth of the far-left within the Democrat Party.
142006	They break laws and want total power and control over the American people
142007	The obsession with identify politics. Constantly making points about race. The focus on transgender topics and constantly discussing abortion. No policy focused on international issues and the economy. Additionally, the lack of focus on the border crisis.
142008	the way they are currently handling this country
142009	The Democratic Party is too liberal and of late are getting on the radical side and bad judgement of things. They have become lost sheep. They make policy that takes money away from good people and gives it to bad behavior. Government should not support or promote that.
142010	too far left boys in girls sports, taking away freedoms
142011	Far too often they fall short of the party's ideals; they would rather win elections than do what is right and just.

142031	Almost as pro-capital as republicans
142032	tax and spend and blame others for their mistakes
142035	The Democrats routinely state misinformation about all the issues facing the country. They spread lies and rumors that are nowhere near true. They framed Trump for the Russia Collusion. They have attacked the Republicans at every turn. They have brought (through the Dem Prosecutors) numerous cases against Trump that would not have been brought if he had not beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016
142041	lack of parental rights specifically with kids who want to transition, pro abortion, immigration, over spending budget,
142043	Not doing enough to make change
142045	America Citizens may not be ready for Women as President
142046	Some of the 'woke' or liberal candidates views on law and order are out of touch with urban reality. example lack of prosecution of shop lifters even serial shop lifters
142047	Neither party is interested in discussing the issues of the people. They are both too wrapped up on digging up dirt on each other. I want to know how they plan to help their constituents and the problems that we are facing. I don't care about the dirt they think they can dig up.
142050	Too polarized. No compromise.
142051	 they do things to help them selves not to help the people
142057	They want to control every aspect of our individual lives.
142059	This isn't only limited to the Ds. The Rs face the same issues. But I really don't like how the party system is working right now. It feels like elected officials are kept in their place through party power. It seems like it is more about the power position of Ds versus Rs and not about the business of taking care of the people of the US. Overall, it feels like is not working well right now. It's too caught up in political division.
142061	I dislike the inability of them to implement policy in the face of opposition, as noted in the complete lack of action in the destruction of Roe vs Wade.
142063	Open borders,for abortion,far too left,and weak foreign policies
142068	they've still not quite where they should be, and i think it's because they are all too old and old fashioned. we need more than 2 major parties to choose from
142070	their extremism with border, gender, abortion.. everything!!!
142073	everything they stand for
142077	lack of fortitude at times
142078	All the pride stuff. Trying to expose children to adult gender choices. Open boarders.... I feel the rest of the world laughs at the US since the democrats have been in charge.
142079	Equity as a movement is our path to a totalitarian state
142082	The complete and utter chaos that has been caused since Obama departed. No fresh blood, no clear succession of leadership and they ended up producing Kamala who i dont think is the greatest candidate to beat Trump.
142083	they are the party of abortion, socialism/communism and bizarre contradictions. in short, it’s the party of “ not as smart as they think they are” folks with useless degrees and $60k in college loan debt
142084	Tendency to be a little disorganized, timid, infighting
142085	Perception of Over-Regulation, Government Spending and Debt, Perception of Identity Politics, Economic Policies

142090	The way they left Afghanistan. Open boarder [CHAR(10)]drug trafficking policies. not hard on crime. [CHAR(10)]not favorable to oil & gas. alliance with corrupt pharmaceutical companies. using the FBI CIA against political opponents, the Republican party
142093	SK
142094	Immigration and constant lying to the public
142095	They don't push hard enough much of the time. I thought abandoning Biden was a weak move. We need single payer health care and they're not working on that.
142096	They need to be more unified to get more legislation passed
142098	corporate shills, not left enough
142099	The leaders need to fight back harder against those who break the law in congress.
142102	supportive of woke" issues"
142103	They work on emotions and not logic - using most sources of media to propagate their agenda. [CHAR(10)]No truth (i.e., fake news) is propagated to where those who don't use their mind to question or think are persuaded incorrectly.
142105	Too liberal on transgender rights
142107	Coddling the radical base to the point of supporting terrorists, committing violence against anyone who disagrees, lying even when there is video or written evidence to the contrary, ignoring the American people on many issues just because they can.
142108	too much to type
142109	They do not make good choices for the country
142110	The party has a lot of really old folks in leadership. The party is too cozy with business. The party isn't playing hardball on the issues of the courts.
142111	pro murder up until birth, flooding the country with illegals, weak foreign policy, becoming further communist and socialist no longer the Democratic Party of JFK or Clinton, 2 tier justice system and becoming more analogous to the Stasi and Brown Shirts, anti freedom and anti democracy party
142112	Other than trying to take away my second amendment rights, It appears that neither party can get anything done other than to bash each other.
142115	The democratic party tries to mislead people from the truth and tries to get democrats to hate republicans and Trump.
142121	certain political stances feel too extreme.
142125	Funding things that the US has no business spending tax payer money on.
142126	they are too disjointed
142128	their policies on the border, economy,[CHAR(10)]foreign affairs, abortion
142129	Their behavior.
142131	abortion policy, foreign policy, immigration policy
142133	Their policies and intentions for leading the country. Too Socialist and communist in the direction they are going.
142135	corrupt and too controlling
142136	most
142138	You know, I can't think about anything right now -- when contrasted to today's Republican MAGA crowd, it's hard to see how the Democratic Party can be viewed in anything but a favorable light right now by comparison.
142139	While their intentions are good, they seem to do a lot of talking without getting much accomplished. It's almost like they get in their own way. For the 2020 election, there were several running for president, all arguing for themselves when they should have been a more united front.
142141	Their stance on abortion and push for children to make decisions bout gender with lack of support of family.
142142	their policies and mind set and values do not align with mine
142145	open borders, millions of undocumented immigrants throughout country, increased drug and human trafficking because of it. The inflation rate and price of homes and food
142146	Too many corporate Dems and not enough that fight for the people. Citizens United has eliminated the voice of the professional, middle and working class. All representatives work for their own interest and the interest of corporations. Soft on immigration. High paying tech jobs are now being outsourced to lower cost areas with lower skilled workers just to make more profits. Housing is unbelievable compared to just 5 years ago, how are younger generations ever going to have families and buy a home? These issues never get addressed by our representatives.
142150	they only think of themselves and not the people
142152	the way they are handling the illegal immigrants
142153	The Democratic party is not the party of the people, for the people. They bring destruction and chaos into every major city they run. California has been run by Pelosi, Newsom and Fienstein and it is now a sewer. So many people leaving California, New York, Chicago, Washington State and moving to Republican Common-sense run states to raise children and earn a living in clean NON feces filled sidewalk, drug infested zombie zones seeing lives wasted by Democratic policies.
142155	Their apparent inability to vote in lockstep when it’s necessary to overcome the GOP’s stalling tactics.
142162	They need to watch spending and cut back on bureaucracy. I would like to see a line item veto. A bill should be straight forward without added special interests.""
142165	stance on abortion
142169	I wish they were more progressive and had better messaging. I think they are often too focused on culture war issues and don't drive home enough that they're the party that's aligned with helping the middle and working class. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I dislike things like them often trying to reach across the aisle" and negotiate with republicans who have absolutely had no interest in negotiating with them. For example they're trying to pass a very conservative border policy plan that republicans claimed to like. Naturally the republicans refused to vote for it. I think Dems shouldn't try to outflank republicans on immigration, that's not a fight they're going to win. They should just embrace being the party that brought about the DREAM act, they should support a path to citizenship, they shouldn't allow the republican narrative about there being a "invasion of migrants" or anything like that because it's not true and it's just making them look bad and weak and they're doubling down on it by trying to pass bad policy. "
142170	They can not be in step with the American people sometimes. they look out for themselves instead of the people.
142171	stance on abortion, gay rights and lack of morals
142175	Every policy the support. How killing unborn babies is the most important thing in the world to them. And that they deny that America is being invaded and conquered slowly.
142176	Sometimes they allow the Republicans to run over them without real push back.
142177	there are plenty of things that come to mind but immigration and the party panning to wokeness movement are two good reasons
142178	policy is to socialist
142182	I don't like the way they are handling immigration and homelessness.
142185	I don’t like their foreign policy or immigration policy
142187	lots of wasteful spending.
142191	Too lenient with communication and sanctions with China
142192	Everything they stand for
142193	Some members are way too liberal, almost socialist.
142194	they waited too long to force Biden to drop out as candidate
142195	Again, the support for non-therapeutic abortion. Neither party has EVER put forward a cogent argument for its position on this issue. They haven't even defined what the hell they are talking about: is this thing a human person/being or not? And if they say it isn't then just when -- at what microsecond in its life -- does the change from non person to person occur? There are 4 requirements which must be fulfilled to have a position on the issue as it relates to the Constitution. Is the unborn entity a human being or not? (Its genome seems to prove that it is, even at the point of conception.) If not, then what is it? Is the unborn entity a person"? Do the provisions of the 14th amendment apply to it in utero (and why do they apply), or does the entity have to be "born" first? You'd better be sure what you're talking about if you want to have a valid argument about anything. Neither side has fulfilled even that first step."
142196	far left Democrats[CHAR(10)]immigration,,, law enforcement [CHAR(10)]
142201	Lack of focus on our country first.
142207	lack of backbone to correct the supreme court and initiative to eliminate electoral college
142209	The party has gone too far to left on most issues. They seemed to be disconnected from the people.
142210	I just answered that question.
142211	It's all about cirhttps://anes.isr.umich.edu/pre/Resources/Images/AnesNextButton.pngcling their wagons.
142212	The fact they are trying to destroy our country while giving anything and everything to other countries. They have caused a huge lack of respect for the US and know that this current administration has no backbone.
142213	gun control views. they are typically more sweeping and less pointed.
142215	more worried about beating Trump then improving our country. The last 4 years have been awful, we won't survive 4 more years
142216	i wish the democrats and republicans could work together for the well being of the united
142218	too many lies, too much conspiracies in the last years ...
142219	The Party does not act agressive
142220	The Dems eat their own. If someone significant is accused of something wrong or a crime. The Dems get rid of them. Today's Republicans don't do anything at all and go into protection mode. I think Biden should not have withheld arms to Ukraine and agreed to cut the apron strings earlier by sending Ukraine hat they were begging for. I believe Biden should never have hugged Netanyahu. Beebe took advantage of our empathy and simply ran/runs without abandon.
142222	Everything that is going on now. We have people rioting and nothing is done about it for days. People are here that came across the border who have raped, murdered U.S. citizens. Our police are being murdered. Secret Service needs to be overhauled.
142223	I do not like the incessant push for support and tolerance for everyone’s beliefs, preferences and lifestyles.Personally, I believe everyone can live the life they want as long as they don’t hurt others. I also believe that the super conservative Christian has every right to their very conservative views as well. Tolerance has to be across the board for EVERYONE, including those super conservatives out there. You can’t expect everyone to conform to the parties standards.
142224	there stand on gun control
142225	Their reckless spending and continued raising of the debt limit, their dumb policies that are economically stupid like student debt cancelation and giving money to home buyers who haven't saved enough. Their tolerance of gender fluidity and the forcing of government institutions to accept and even promote ideas like gender identification.
142229	It has not fostered the ascendency of new leadership, especially in the Congress, the result of which is a leadership of gerontocracy, with the exception of Pelosi promoting Jefferies. The worst result was letting Biden firm up his claim to run for a second term.
142232	Limited focus on serious dangers
142233	I don’t like it’s general stance on certain issues like religious freedom, abortion, or the socialistic approach to solving healthcare, educational, and welfare needs.
142234	Economic, foreign, & immigration policies
142235	they are too liberal and giving everything free to people so people don’t want to work
142239	They do not act far enough to protect the vulnerable both in this country and abroad. Free Palestine.
142243	I don't like anything about that party
142245	not helping on the border, the economy, not supporting the average guy
142246	sus actuaciones tímidas en relación con lo que debiera hacer frente a Autocratas y Dictaduras criminales y violadoras de Derechos Humanos en el mundo.
142247	abortion on demand, whenever
142251	they dont lime change
142254	not tough on criminals
142255	HANDLING OS ISREAL WASTING TO MUCH TIME ON WOKE ISSUES AND NOT HANDLING CRIME AND FOREIGN RELATIONS PROPERLY
142259	The rise of the Progressive wing of the party has been scary and, I believe, dangerous. Along with this rise is the rise of the sentiment/test of purity - if you don't believe in one thing, then you must be as bad as [insert boogeyman/Republican]. Combining this with the fact that some people refuse to compromise (say, I won't vote for Biden b/c of his policy on X) when faced with a fully existential crisis, the Democratic Party has very much been on the edge of complete and total disaster.
142261	Far left progressives- I do not think college tuition should be paid for. students must have financial skin the the game.
142266	They are not closely aligned with Biblical principles.
142269	the far left needs to slide a little to the center at times
142270	I believe that Democrats believe the economy should benefit everyone, health care is a right, our diversity is our strength, and democracy is worth defending. Everyone deserves the opportunity to live and thrive.
142272	fiscally more irresponsible, creates an ,”us vs. them” (have vs have not) mentality and fosters this division.
142273	Embrace of big government; regulations; too swayed by progressive left. Religion of climate change. Stance on Israeli security. They are the party of the coastal elite.
142274	there pro abortion pro lgbtq
142278	Lies, lies, lies. They are bringing down America.
142282	Godless, amoral, confused, un-American, do not regard history nor the constitution of the United States.
142283	Very little concern with the party beyond not making gun safety a stronger focus, and falling into the BS of being a politician with all the rhetoric that gets in the way of being a good representative for us. I wish we could find a common footing for health care issues vs the extreme of Bernie Sanders and the lockout of some democratic reps as they end up shutting down the vote option on important issues. I don't agree with the party people stick together beyond ethical behaviors (ie exteeme Republicans and the rest of the party echoing their issues), yet would like more of this in a moderate way on things like gun safety, etc.
142284	for the most part over the past several years they have been too “polite” toward the far right’s antics
142285	neither party is all the honest and trust worthy
142287	they are trying to run this country like a communist country
142288	Leadership
142289	adding to the national debt.
142291	LIBERALISM IGNORANCE OF REALITY LACK OF COMMON SENSE .. LACK OF SPIRITUALITY
142293	spend to much money. stop aiding everyone. fix America first!
142294	many members are too old
142295	overspending and too generous in helping
142296	Many tend to spend more money in campaigns and in budgets. There needs to be a balance between policy and spending so much.
142297	Give free stuff to many people. Keeping border open which is extremely bad.[CHAR(10)]Giving tons of dollars to Ukraine
142302	Approach to illegal immigrants. They're intruders, not guests. No holds barred abortions. Soft on crime, Trump is to blame for everything attitude.
142303	Up until the move towards Harris, they weren't taking enough action to move the party in the right direction to sustain itself for longer, there wasn't a clear direction for the party post Biden. They have not done enough to force fair taxation across all brackets.
142305	The way they handle issue, small issues become more grand
142306	value and beliefs
142307	All aspects of the progressive left, especially anti-Israel and anti-law-and-order sentiments.
142311	The lack of a clear message on unity.
142313	I dislike their ideology.
142316	their views on gun control
142317	the border is a big issue and financially feel like things have gotten out of control. also in terms of foreign politics feel less in control
142320	supporting the size of the H1B program while many American IT workers have been laid off in the last two years.
142321	Becoming socialist. Total failure on immigration policy. The primary cause of inflation. Totally failed at foreign policy. Made the US the laughing stock of the world. Soft on crime, etc., etc. Total failure.
142325	dont agree with foreign immigration policies
142326	They tend to be immoral overall.
142329	I don't agree with some of the extreme left elements of the party .
142330	IMMIGRATION POLICY; SANCTUARY CITY POLICY; ABORTION POLICY
142332	The fact that they are sometimes wishy-washy with supporting their own party members. The fact that they have not fully condoned Israel's behavior in the world.
142338	 
142339	I’d like to see them fight the Alt-Right more. sometimes it seems like we keep taking the hits and not standing up for little guy as much as we could.
142340	-sometimes they are not strong enough on immigration laws/regulation
142342	raise taxes on people hand out tax payer money
142347	I would prefer a more left-wing option.
142348	transgenderism being thrown in my face. Bidens senility being denied. Since he was senile, who was REALLY running the country?
142349	I still believe that on occasion that they need to grow some balls! Stand up and speak out loud for what they believe in and do not accept the bullying around them from the other party and it's followers.
142351	They are in congress to gain for themselves, and not the country
142352	Spending too much money on government programs and sometimes ignoring middle class needs.
142354	it’s weakness re Israel’s continuing destruction of Gaza
142355	Border Crime Lack of support for law and order. College tuition forgiveness on backs of tax payers. Economy. Energy. National Security. Foreign Affairs.
142356	encouraging illegals
142358	Overall, the party seems quite corrupt and eager to coronate favored insiders, without much consideration for what voters want. At the local level here in California they've pushed so much bad policy and let problems fester for far too long. I only tend to vote Democrat because the Republicans are even worse.
142363	They need to stop playing nice with the GOP and fight back.
142365	They should be tackling climate change more aggressively.
142367	they seem to be over the top on some issues.
142368	Immigration policy. Socialist economic pursuits. Lack of law enforcement. Support for abortion. Rigid gun control. Weak foreign policy.
142370	For Trump's entire term and beyond they have done everything in their power (Mueller investigation, impeachments, weaponized the FBI and Justice Dept.) to derail his presidency and imprison him, all while ignoring corruption in the Biden family.
142371	Their pursuit of agendas that enact their extremist views including open borders, high taxes, and weak foreign policy. Also their policies on abortion, child transgender, business over-regulation, and wasteful spending.
142372	Crazy progressive policies ... Lunatics
142373	-preference of an electorate which subverts and breaks the law over those following the law[CHAR(10)]-extreme leftist and tyrannical tendencies[CHAR(10)]-encouraging gender dysphoria and chemical castration, especially within children
142378	they caused all sorts of problems
142379	I don't like their position on abortion.
142380	I disagree with the stance on allowing transgender women to take rights away from biological women
142381	policy positions
142384	Their policies push for larger government and higher taxes when people are already struggling.
142387	They are communists and are tearing this country apart and selling out to China as Biden is in bed with them and has been.
142388	Democratic party is giving too much attention to a few types of extremists that represent only a couple of percent of Democratic party voters: defund the police, prison abolitionism, decolonization, antiracism as opposed to affirmative action, anti-Zionism including pro-Hamas/Students for Justice in Palestine/Within Our Lifetime/Jewish Voices for Peace. The Democratic party has ceded ground on contentious issues and often refused to take brave stances against these positions so that it is clear to people how dangerous they are. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have taken at times positions that are unequivocally pro-Hamas, such as denying October 7 atrocities and engaging in Holocaust inversion and the Soviet Zionism=racism, and the Democratic party needs to maintain better party discipline on these issues to make it clear that these stances are all as unacceptable as Holocaust denial.
142389	I feel that the Democratic Party is turning this country into a socialist country. Hard working people are contributing more and more of their paychecks to people who are not contributing financially in society
142390	Everything is wrong with the democratic party. no morals
142393	They seem to be anti-Christian, growingly anti-Jew, pro-death (abortion), soft on violent crime, ineffective at the southern border, spend money as though we have an endless supply, divide people based on race, sexual identity, etc., using the courts to punish their political enemies, leverage the media and big tech to manipulate low information people, are largely anti-free market, use the schools to indoctrinate kids to their point of view, promote sinful lifestyles, etc.

142406	socialism and combining everyones money
142407	The left sides desire to weaken this nation and deteriorate the morals and values of our younger generations.
142409	I feel like the old Democrats 30 years ago were better. The new Democrats are just bandwagon liberals. Too extreme. Republicans are also too extreme now a days. Common sense is lacking everywhere. We cant save everyone. The government wants to tell us how to live but dont practice what they preach.
142410	Haven't found a successful way to counteract Trump and MAGA culture. Some policy positions attempt to pacify too many groups of people.
142415	they over react to its own who make mistakes

142441	They are terrible at politics in general
142442	absolute lack of integrity, purpose and direction
142443	I don’t like the fact and find it difficult to believe that in this great country of ours, we can’t come up with a Democratic leader who is young, incredibly bright, and is qualified to run for the presidency. Personally, I feel that Pete Buttigieg is far more qualified than Kamala Harris, but unfortunately, this country is not ready for a gay president
142445	The policies and arrogance
142446	Far to liberal leaning. Need to come back to the middle and get back to negotiated settlement of problems and issues.

142448	open boarders and giving aid to the rest of the world
142451	They're finally starting to fight against the Republican Party for what the constituents want instead of being pushovers.
142452	In their attempt to take care of the most needy individuals, they appear to continue to try to put themselves in the position of savior. That is a dangerous position for someone in government to be in. First of all, because government is NOT efficient in taking care of those who have needs. Secondly, encouraging people to rely on the government provides a significant amount of control over those individuals -- they can be somewhat manipulated by the threat" of 'if you don't vote for me, you lose all this.'"
142453	ideology is not matching my own. I feel like these people are delusional and how things are run or should be run
142455	they kill babies. that is a bad idea and they will regret it in the end. They also encourage homosexuality which is an abomination to the Lord.they will regret that too.they also don’t support Israel which God says is also a bad idea.

142473	The Democratic Party would benefit from being better organized and getting better messaging to ensure their supporters are more vocal, visible and actively voting.

142483	they are destroying the US! Turing it into a liberal disaster, no control on crime, just catch and release, not helping the middle class, pissing away tax dollars-wasteful meaningless spending. Letting any criminal into the US and doing nothing about it. Lowering drug costs without understanding or explaining to people the REAL reason drugs costs so much, to make newer drug!
142486	Bad war habits. They always concern us in someone's war just so they can receive benefits on the back side.
142488	the way they act don’t try to compromise with the people
142490	They are slow to acknowledge their accomplishments.

142508	Far to liberal on matters of moral
142511	They are too scared to be progressive. They are too worried that people like Bernie Sanders and AOC are too progressive to be 100% supported for presidency or higher positions that it’ll scare the general public and fear loss of votes. That they have too many conservative democrats like Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Diane Feinstein, and the like, in office for long periods of time and don’t promote/support younger generations in fear of being too progressive.

142523	I do think that minimum wage has gone way too high for jobs that were never intended to support a family. That has made the price of many goods and services go up. We need to think of how to help people with programs that give them a hand up- less hand outs.
142524	all they want is power & money for themselves. the health & well-being of the people are not the priority of worker either party
142526	They tend to bend to the will of every new trend.

142561	I don't like that some elected officials in the Democratic Party still own stock - they should put all stock in a blind trust and not contact their stockbrokers while in office. Their work as Representatives and Senators gives them too much inside information. I would like it if Democrsts supported more public financing of electoral campaigns so that people with less money were able to run for offuce.

142590	Do not like the far left policies.
142591	the democratic party support is becoming extreme and I'm actually leaving the coutry because of it. This country is not safe and the people are bad people.
142593	very weak party
142594	Well, they haven't been able to rein in the Republicans or keep the Supreme Court balanced; compromise with Republicans has proved to be nearly impossible, but that's not mostly the fault of the Democrats.

142597	I want clarity from the party around their goals and how we will achieve them. I am excited about Harris as a candidate--but I think it took too long to get there. I think some of the elder statesmen of the party are too fearful

205321	They need to be stronger in opposing the radical Right. 
205363	Their lack of a strong brand and the party's lack of support for local down ballot candidates.

205452	They have no common sense. 
205471	The democratic party has strayed from its original beliefs 
205512	Instead of working together with the Republican Party and try agreeing to work together on what’s best for our country they constantly biker with each other 
205554	I don't like that Democrats have unrealistic expectations. They think they can contribute to global issues, but all they're doing is guilting those who don't share their beliefs and exacerbating problems. They are passionate, but not for/with the right intentions/reasons.[CHAR(10)]Also, they're terrible when it comes to economics. 
205577	creating a group of followers that blindly accept gov. control 
205657	they are slow to take action sometimes 
205742	Previously stated. Not a single policy that is good for the US. Don't understand why they opened the border, killed domestic energy policy. Weak Foreign policy. The only thing that makes sense is that Joe Biden, his family, and others have been paid off by foreign interests to make decisions designed to be the 1000 cuts that ultimately accomplish the goal of our enemies... To destroy the US! 
205748	Many democrats run on a platform of basic human decency, but then they just vote where the money takes them once they have the platform.

205926	The lies that constantly spew out. The country is in a mess and has been since they took office in 2020, but yet they think they are doing a wonderful job. Inflation is off the chart. Immigration is out of control. Millions in the country who are not vetted. They bring in drugs, rape and murder our citizens and yet the boarder remains open. Biden is the worst President this country has had. 
206002	SPENDING, AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPALS, BIG GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOTHING FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, WOKE MENTALITY, PROMOTE MULTIPLE GENDERS, RACE-BATING, CLASS WARFARE, CREATE DIVISION THRU IDENTITY-POLITICS, SOFT ON CRIME, HARD ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

206326	everything they do is crooked and they lie about everything 
206379	They want to be woke 
206385	The Demoncrats pushing a fairly “wasted” person run for Senator, let alone let him win. It shows the results of people’s lack of knowledge. 
206445	Unrealized gains tax 
206469	Prices are inflated when a democrat is in office. 
206562	on occasion too timid and reluctant to blow their own trumpet 
206598	Anti United States policies. 
206616	they have not acted more effectively in the border crisis

207033	I do not approve of how Joe Biden and the Democratic Party has handled the war in Israel and Gaza. I believe Israel is committing genocide and that should be denounced by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democratic Party. I do not believe which continue to provide aid to Israel as they are just slaughtering Palestinian people. 
207089	Some progressives have alienated middle of the road voters leading to declining support for the Democratic Party particularly in the South and rural areas throughout the country. 
207095	
207124	Accepting AIPAC donations, other large PAC/corporate donations 
207160	economic policy, free handouts 
207244	Some of their viewpoints can swing extremely to the left. This being done without thoughtful analysis of what extreme decisions can result in. Case in point, the blanket denunciation of the state of Israel in lieu of the crisis and military action in Palestinian Gaza. 
207290	They regularly come off very weak-willed and middling in many cases. Some congressmen and senators also appear very insincere when speaking. 
207320	Funding foreign wars. Lobbyist

207813	Lately more mud-slinging than policy making 
207830	Too hardcore. 
207842	They fall weak to the republicans. 
207866	I think the Democratic Party occasionally tries too hard to appease the most moderate/conservative factions of the party instead of wholeheartedly embracing extremely popular progressive policies. I understand the motivation, given that even something as benign as, say, caring about marginalized communities will get you labeled as a ar-left radical by right-wing media propagandists, and that is detrimental when trying to win over voters (particularly low information voters who only have vague concepts of progressivism and who are under the false impression that republicans are better on issues like crime and the economy). I am also concerned that there is sometimes a lack of moral courage, for instance with respect to the tragedy unfolding in Gaza. 
207872	how they did not stand together and make President Biden step down before the primary! 
207884	stop the loopholes of letting people come in across the border without any true need to this country 
207890	I certainly feel the US border is a big issue. 
207914	Taking virtue signaling too far, how they handles Covid, taking away more right and higher taxes 
207956	I feel they are disingenuous about identity politics.

208308	higher taxes, spending, national debt, abortion law stance, gun control stance 
208360	immigration policy 
208366	In some cases, regulation has gone too far and makes for inefficient economies. There are aspects of the party that push regulation too far, in my opinion. 
208372	Influenced too much by progressives in the party 
208390	identity politics, LGBTQ policies 
208425	They give too many handouts 
208431	I think they are too open minded and forgiving in terms of free hand outs for people. I think they are too loose on immigration. I think they spend too much money taking care of foreign countries and also too much money for people who choose not to work. 
208443	unflinching support of Israel

208883	a stronger stance on the Israeli war- stop funding the war & genocide on innocent civilians 
208901	i dislike the woke idealogy they push. right and wrong, that is it. male or female, that is it. burning cities down because a group is upset over an issue is stupid. can i go burn their house down bc they upset me? 
208907	their communist leanings 
208919	they seem to favor crime, illegal imagrants and want to set policy based on a very small minority 
208937	Mainly, their stance on the Second Amendment and trying to do away with our right to firearms. 
208943	I used to be a Democrat until Obama’s mid term. They have become way too liberal and out of touch with the average American. 
208992	I think they need to be better organized to fight against the Republicans and the damage they (Rep) have done over the last few years. I no longer trust the Supreme Courts Justices and the Dems need to do something to correct that. 
209004	The Candidates we have for Presidential options 
209010	I do feel they need a stronger immigrations policy ... but they are moving in the right direction 
209052	Unpredictable.

209152	every policy[CHAR(10)]abortion [CHAR(10)]gender ideology 
209212	the left has gone too left — harming our people, policies, economy, environment 
209287	Loose policies on some things like sex changes, immigration, foreign aid, and welfare. Obamacare ruined the ability for middle class to afford to take care of themselves. 
209293	deficit spending and immigration 
209316	Democrats given from the center, where Nixon used to be, and anything progressive needs to be forced into a conversation for them to even consider it. and that's more true as one moves up from down ticket offices to the top of the ticket. and to move up from those down ticket offices, one really has to leave progressive ideals at home. look at recent AOC statements, she's starting to advocate for the center folks in a way that hints to me she's angling for a move up 
209328	overspending, trappings of welfare, zero moderate approach, destruction of the middle class 
209340	not sure. i know they are not perfect. maybe focus a little more on smaller government 
209370	they try to do the right thing 
209382	I dislike their social policies, especially those surrounding the issue of life. life should be protected and not treated haphazardly. 
209394	Too Liberal. I like a balance between the two. 
209459	They give out too much Government Assistance 
209508	lack of support for Israel 
209621	Will do anything, legal or not, to win! Hate people with different views. Uses the media to spread their message and don't tell both sides. Very corrupt. 
209633	They always hand out money to the same old people that dont want to get off their ass and work. 
209635	Their policy on Immigration, DEI, Transgender policy, Green Energy policies, their almost socialist platform 
209700	They don’t go far enough in their support for social justice 
209806	I do not particularly like the economic standings of most democrats and most of the immigration policies they have. Social policies are pretty good but I accidentally passed the good things too fast my bad. 
209855	
209893	Deficit spending, obsession with identity politics 
209969	The US and Michigan constitution is used as a guide 
209981	Big government, high taxes and inflation. They say that they are working for the middle class when in fact they are and have been crushing us. Poor foreign relations, wars, policies, and lies. 
210033	THEY DON'T FIGHT BACK LIKE THE OTHER PARTY!! THEY NEED TO DO THEM THE SAME WAY THEY DO THEM!!! 
210045	they thought Biden was a good a idea 
210063	Spend too much money; don’t protect our borders; too lenient on crime; don’t support the police 
210092	abortion policies[CHAR(10)]child abuse 
210135	too hawkish on foreign policy. not strong enough in opposition to extremist views from the right 
210165	
210177	I hope their policies don't make or debt grow. If you enact a plan, offer a way to pay for it. 
210207	cheating, lying, pro-choice, defund police 
210219	I clicked the wrong response but it won't let me go back.

210273	
210285	too much government control 
210297	pretty much everything else their policies support 
210387	I think that the Democratic Party could be doing more in terms of innovating economic policies that support not only the wealth of the country but also that of the collective individual. I think that one of the major dividers between Democrats and Republicans is this battle of economy vs human rights, and I think if the Democratic Party could become more holistic in their approach to legislation (as opposed to harping/relying on solely their human rights approach), we may see more cohesiveness and progress between parties within the political system. 
210405	Poor economy strategies and strongly impact those they are trying to help socially from systematic oppression 
210440	
210544	Big federal government is less likely to represent the needs of its citizens as effectively. Policies have a lot of bloat and wasted money. Influenced by corporations money. 
210614	Support for Israel 
210650	how they're handling Gaza 
210698	progressive agenda 
210728	pro abortion[CHAR(10)]anti border control[CHAR(10)]

210783	They did not stop the Supreme Court from becoming so political and corrupt. 
210806	
210854	They have become Communist, Marxist, and hateful racists. 
210860	they always promote politicians who are not favored 
210992	Unregulating votes in political elections, ie. no voter ID. Letting borders remain open causing an international drug and crime crisis. Spending 100s of billions on two foreign wars. Using media outlets to smear politicians. Weaponizing the FBI/CIA against political opponents. Lying about inflation and the causes. 
211036	They have no idea what the people need. I work 7 days a week and can't afford to live. I'm tired of this. I won't be able to afford a car for my child or her education. I can barely afford to keep a roof over her head. They are sneaky, they are greedy and they are not for the american people 
211054	I do not like the things that have been occuring every time a Democrat gets into office. It is like hearing and seeing a three ring circus. 
211099	Not a fan of the far left ideas. 
211105	not as much but seems to take a side of just the democratic party and not anything about Republicans ideas and won't work together for our country 
211128	Could be stronger on immigration policy and reform, Israel/Palestine conflict. 
211140	Need to have intentional succession plans to identify and support strong candidates. Don't leave things to chance. 
211164	I don’t agree with the border policies 
211176	I feel like i just awnsered that 
211187	Democrats can be too liberal and too far from the center of American politics. 
211241	The party regularly seems to struggle with inner disagreements and seems to struggle handling themselves against the Republican Party. 
211258	they are not for the american people. They are one for themselves. 
211306	Everything. Democrats are no longer democrats; they've slide much further left on the political spectrum and are now more aligned with communist and Marxist ideology. With the backing of mainstream media and Hollywood...they've become far too powerful and cannot be reasoned with regarding their support of destructive, violent tendencies. 
211389	giving away funds to buy votes, increasing our debt 
211407	everything about it 
211430	l dont like their immigration polices, letting too many illegals into the country. 
211468	No respect for others opinions. Speaking your mind around them is often shut down or met with disgust. 
211492	I honestly really do believe that the vast majority are lying cheats and I have watched it over and over again. Democrats historically look the other way, categorically refuting the obvious, even with hard evidence of misconduct, or treasonous criminal activity, 1.Hillary Clinton and her Russian Dossier, that Democrats created 2. Hillary “bleaching” and smashing and destroying evidence that would have clearly land her in jail. 3. Adam Schiff’s convoluted investigation on the Dossier, and of Trump, 4. Hunter Biden Laptop, 5. The Biden family Influence Peddling Scheme 6. Cover Up of Joe Biden mental health and acuity. 7. Election Interference with the unprecedented Law-fare of Joe Bidens political opponent. I have never seen anything like this in my life!!!! and yes, I also do believe that there was cheating in the 2020 election by the Democratic Party. They have repeatedly proven that there is nothing they will not say or do to win…. 
211566	immigration, taxes 
211626	They need to do a better job of fighting back against mis information. 
211656	they are weak & compromise when they shouldn’t 
211662	boarder control 
211673	The Democratic Party is largely unable or unwilling to push for drastic enough measures to move the country in the right direction. My feelings towards them are not as actively negative as my feeling towards other parties, but they never fail to disappoint. 
211828	hateful, bad policies, divisive 
211834	The college debit needs to set and not changed every year. Close the border. Take better care of own American legal citizens first. 
211852	Extremism. I consider myself to be more moderate and the far left part of the Democratic party is hurting our chances of success in the country. 
211858	they have no back bone, the economy is in shambles but yet they all think it's just great. 
211911	They dont fact check and stand up to Republicans when they should. 
211941	They lie. flip flop on issues, spend money on bs 
211958	The pandering they do. 
211964	giving everything away 
211982	they hate America & the American citizens, but love chaos, war, abortion, [CHAR(10)]pedophilia, tax & spend our $$ 
211994	governmental spending 
212018	they have become a reactionary party. seeing disagreement as hate.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I don’t know why we tax if we have no interest keeping the national debt in check… it seems like we only tax as a form of punishment if we can just not worry about the interest payments 
212125	open border policy 
212167	they don't seem to address the problems as well as the Republicans do of the real things that are going on in our country 
212237	immigration policy open borders, and relief to foreign countries 
212260	
212294	The over Progressive and Liberal Elected Officials 
212300	they wish to destroy the US. they are corrupt and lie about everything 
212359	Their economic policy isn’t the best. I believe in equity over equality, but I think that equity forgets about the middle class the same way the Republican Party does…at least the democrats are trying to help the poor instead of keeping the top 3% wealthy. 
212388	98% of their beliefs. (I answered the previous question incorrectly. ) 
212400	not pushing people to be responsible humans and always wanting to bail people out 
212405	their work on Palastine 
212411	They want to take away our rights and freedom 
212417	very liberal agenda 
212423	They don’t get anything done. 
212429	I feel this democratic party is more concerned with getting into the Oval Office than caring for the people. 
212441	everything the do is harmful to America. [CHAR(10)]its all about making everyone have the same outcome without everyone putting in the same effort. 
212475	would like to see a better immigration policy. 
212493	don’t stand up enough as a unified group 
212504	Their inability to Get Their Shit Together! To send a clear and concise message to the American people. To proudly and loudly announce This Is What We Have Done For You! To work together. The republicans wrote the book on in fighting and look where it got them. So the Democrats need to stop hiding in their shell and take control. 
212510	Every position they take is evil. The old Democratic Party was a good party. I voted for many of them through the years. This new party is evil. 
212534	They are corrupt and continue to state accusations against Trump that have been proven by Special Prosecutor to be false.[CHAR(10)]They are anti-Christian is most policies. They are anti-semitic.[CHAR(10)]They support poor education and suppress poor people in the process.[CHAR(10)]They support illegal immigration even though it is harmful to the immigrants.[CHAR(10)]Polosi and Schumer and others are too old and have lost the mental abilities.[CHAR(10)]

212968	all they care about is themselves and what they want for themselves. they don’t do their job for America or it’s people. 
212980	Their views 
212998	They can tend to talk down to voters. Especially those that do not agree with them. 
213012	Spend,spend, spend! Don’t get anything done in Congress. Negative scores on crime, immigration, economy, homelessness, national debt 
213024	climate science denial, no women’s right to choose, no gun control, election denial, anti EPA, anti any government regulation of businesses, and worst of all, unconditional fealty to Trump. 
213053	their push for the destruction of the United States, our Constitution, our morals and ethics. They lie cheat and steal any way possibly to keep themselves in power at the detriment of their own constituents. Most politicians, but I see it far mor frequently in the Dem Party, only serve themself, not the country.[CHAR(10)]Specific policy issues I despise:[CHAR(10)]push towards socialism[CHAR(10)]immigration/open boarders[CHAR(10)]Abortion[CHAR(10)]Authoritarian Public Health[CHAR(10)]CRT[CHAR(10)]DEI[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)] 
213059	A shitty foil to a shittier problem. Ranked voting or America crumbles to the corruption on both sides. 
213083	they ruin us and sell us out 
213094	the party seems to go out of their way in the idea of acceptance of all people to the point where they are forcing acceptance down the throat of “the typically average person “ basically defeating the original purpose. Rural America feels unseen and misunderstood 
213100	Lack of protection for the unborn, pushing transgender and other cultural agendas on the public and our children, protecting and supporting some minorities but not others 
213124	pro-abortion policy, immigration policies, pro-welfare state policies 
213135	Progressive Wing - too extreme 
213147	they own the FBI cannot get all answers from in certain inquiries hush hush.most things they do are ruining the country 
213159	policies mentioned earlier 
213182	They seek power and will stop at nothing to get that power. Example: Russia, Russia, Russia. Robert Mueller found zero Collusion! The dossier was paid for by the Hillary campaign. 
213201	they have become a very elitist party that has forgotten who makes up the majority of the party 
213212	wokeism policy is ridiculous…totally against

213429	Too liberal, way too much taxation, and foreign policy is weak. 
213435	Too radical especially with the lack of criminal justice. Let's face it, some people are just bad people however they became that way. Legalizing hard drugs? That outcome was obvious. But the DNC learned that LOUD and IN YOUR FACE gets people to listen even when the subject is just odious. 
213453	They have turned to socialism/communist. 
213471	They seem to have gone way too liberal trying to appease fringe groups that are not representative of our nation as a whole 
213489	They are anti-America, anti- traditional family. Most of their political members don't represent their constituents.

213524	Platform stance on abortion. 
213530	too much government, too much spending, too much lawfare, 
213536	also too worried about their own jobs. 
213542	the hard left views that are becoming mainstream. moderate democrats today are left of the Democratic Party from just 20 years ago. it’s obvious that the far right emerged to counter these far left views but democrats are absorbing the far left views into their mainstream 
213578	putting illegal people before America citizens 
213595	Everything. Abortion, immigration, entitlements, inflation, economy, wars, etc

223438	they lie too much and weaponize the government 
223462	A war is going on and Biden is at a beach! 
223468	It is the party that proudly subverts the values that have made America the greatest nation on earth. They work night and day to weaken America. It has become a cancer in this country.

223765	What the democratic party stands for now has changed from what it used to be. Unless it has always been lying to everyone since the beginning. It doesn't stand up for Christian values. They don't control the flow of illegal immigrants coming into our country. They aren't vetted properly. There are children coming over here from other countries that are being sexually abused that have came across the border with people that aren't even family members. There are women that have been sold into being sex slaves. Yes, that may have been happening whenever president Trump was president but he did get a hold on things when he was in office and he stopped the flow from coming in. The fentanyl issues have become worse killing more Americans because of this administration that's in the White House now. Everyone has become poorer because of this administration and how they've handled the economy. We give to people coming in while our Veterans suffer. Many on the streets. And, you can't tell me any different because I see it everyday. There are so many people coming in here that don't care if they are accounted for. We have fallen behind with wars popping up all over the world. I stand with Israel and we just insult Netanyahu through this anti-Semitic administration. We are giving money and military equipment to Ukraine, while our social security will take a hit and our defenses are weakened. It ridiculous.... I won't vote for Kamala just because she's a woman. I look at the big picture here. Like I said, you would have to blind, can't and completely dumb to not see what's going on.

223967	I just don't feel like they are getting enough done 
224079	any and all woke culture crap. 
224174	They have zero sense when it comes to the actual economy. they think increasing minimum wage is going to help, when in reality what it causes is every single business including grocery stores, restaurants, etc. to increase their prices to accommodate this increase, so it really doesn’t help anyone. 
224287	they’re views on big moral issues are all pretty opposite of mine. 
224316	Very lenient on punishing which increases crimes. It’s like a principal that wants to make everybody happy and nobody hates him or her, but the kids don’t learn and kids go wilder. People know where you stand and take advantage of the situation.

224340	Democrats stands up for middle class people. And poor people. 
224416	They seem very short sighted and do not always have a sense of urgency. Poor cohesive messaging.

224475	need to be more full throated in the distinction of what can and cannot be done with divided government in this current environment. Having the White House is not enough.

224800	Being a moderate, I feel that they lean to the left a bit too much at times. I don't really like extremes, right or left. They can be a bit over board on government spending, though it's a delicate balance between too little and too much. I am a government contractor and I see the waste everyday, though not all on the democrats. 
224841	They seem intent on fighting a war 
224853	Their unwavering support for Israel when it comes to Gaza. 
224882	They need to rise to occasion and do more to crush Trump and his MAGA shit heads. 
224906	I'm going to answer the same for BOTH parties. I do not like the divide and agitation that has occurred in our country over politics. I can understand difference in opinions on policies and ways of governing. I cannot understand or agree with this emotional upheaval over likes & dislikes of our candidate's personalities. It's become a personality contest. On social media or even the news, I don't often hear about the policies being discussed and how they will affect our country for good or bad. I hear more about the dogs and cats being eaten in Springfield or about Kamala's laugh or her accents. I don't vote based on someone's personality, I vote on the policy proposals and whether or not they will change our country for good. My concern is how people will react after the election no matter who gets voted in. 
224918	most of the policys

Has the Democratic Party every stopped and thought for one minute why the Mexican government and cartels are freely letting and allowing people from their country to freely enter America with no strings attached, no Mexican military holding the people back or blocking people from crossing the border. all the people leaving, crossing over to America you would think they would be loosing money and people in their country. why would they allow that? Democratic Party is setting up America to be a communist country, allowing the citizens to become sitting ducks who can not financially support their families , or defend own families if need too. Eventually American citizens will need to seek asylum in another country. The American dream is vanishing for hardworking , middle class, American citizens and their families!! Our son is a first generation college graduate in our family . we are a middle class family, have been working our entire life sometimes two jobs just to provide for our family. our son’s college major was offered at a private college he attended a private college, His parents are married, still alive , no handicaps , no diversity , middle class annual salary. he graduated with college debt for him and his family over [REDACTED] bc he did not meet the above criteria.

Bullies do not respond to nice and descent, they will walk all over you. The Bible tells us to put on the armor and stand, prepared to FIGHT for goodness and truth, against all that is evil.

Nothing epitomizes it more than the Cease Fire Now photo of government elected officials with not a single white person. Bernie Sanders, Katie Porter, Elizabeth Warren, none of them refusing to call for a cease fire?! I see white liberals exploit the votes of marginalized people without caring about any of them. They pretend to care to get their votes and then when it’s time to stand behind their commitment to these groups of people, every time they choose money, power and comfort. They choose upholding white supremacy. 
231739	of course- there’s lots to argue with. (but at least within the Democratic Party it’s possible to argue.) 
231770	weak immigration stance 
231788	disorganized and not forward thinking - seems like republicans are always ahead of democratic leaders - democrats also spend far too much would like to see a few years of moderate spending 
231800	I do not like that they are currently supporting a genocide in Gaza 
231818	It isn't perfect. Even in our democratic eras we have made terrible mistakes 
231824	Harder stance on immigration; improve fiscal conservatism; would prefer more middle of the road social liberalism. 
231962	I think that by its very nature as an inclusive party it struggles to build consensus and message, which makes us an easier target for those seeking to show us as weak and divided. We need to “play the game” the same way our Republican fellow citizens do in order to create a more level playing field. We also need to be more direct in our judgement. 
232027	
232053	not willing to fight for Medicare for all 
232101	Failure to transition to new generation of candidates 
232178	the way it handles immigration borders policies and international law enforcement. 
232229	when they act like Republicans 
232252	Those who are too generous...who want to spend on very good causes, but want to spend more than our government can afford. 
232323	communism[CHAR(10)]socialism [CHAR(10)]higher taxes [CHAR(10)]cancel culture [CHAR(10)]empowering criminals [CHAR(10)]enabling bad actors [CHAR(10)]victim mindset incentivizing [CHAR(10)]anti self reliance[CHAR(10)]anti freedom 
232352	They spend too much tax payer money. 
232415	not enough focus on economy, too lenient in helping other countries out. 
232426	The majority of the party is actually centrist in their views, not left. Not as strongly left as I am. 
232462	the way that money influences those in power 
232549	generally that they are politicians 
232555	campaign finance, stock trading in politics, greenwashing, chowing our candidates for us, moving to lore moderate politics and candidates because it is more “electable” 
232567	Policies and platform generally 
232634	I believe their ousting of Biden was a bold faced coup. I believe they lied to our faces while knowing about Biden’s cognitive decline. I believe they could have found us a better presidential candidate. forcing Kamala onto the ticket is unfavorable. 
232670	too soft on their opponents 
232693	unfocused, ridged 
232734	Anti-tech, too much spending 
232769	support of genocide in Palestine 
232858	They will need to be a stronger force to stand up to and call Trump out on his lies 
232888	Until recently immigration problems were being swept under the rug and even now there are voices in the party that are impractical and unreasonable with respect to immigration and crime (among other things). I also think much of the way they think about income inequality/taxation is misguided and harms the upper middle class more than the actual fiscal elites. 
232900	they are cogs of the banking system just like republicans and all politicians 
233024	bleeding hearts that spend too much tax dollars 
233042	They open our borders and cause extreme inflation. 
233061	bad economy and high crime 
233116	Not enough genuine people running for office 
233193	it can sometimes lean too far left 
233211	taxes rich too low, doesn't focus on universal healthcare

233258	failure to control and lower of percription drugs 
233282	borders [CHAR(10)]economy [CHAR(10)]foreign policy[CHAR(10)]lgbt 
233288	AGAINST SCHOOL CHOICE, weak on defense, poor energy policy, border policy 
233381	Not being more aggressive in tackling corporate greed/greedflation. 
233416	the extreme left. everyone cannot be equal in terms of wealth. there has to be a system. everyone can’t be rich, unfortunately and everything can’t be given away. you need to work for it. also, people MUST come to this country legally. my family did! 
233470	
233541	They’re too hyper-focused on issues that are not nearly as critical or important as some others. 
233595	giving free handouts 
233624	Elitist, Smug, Hypocrits, Fascist leaning, Nazi-sympathizers, Nazi-collaborators, two-faced, liars, rapist harborers, Left-bashing, condescenders who simply wish they were successful Republicans. literally 2 sides of the same rotten coin that will be used to sell out this entire nation, always sneaking around trying to find some new slimy reason to sell out workers, the poor, and underpriviledge for a quick buck 
233647	The extremist left wing is giving away the entire nation to illegals and making its citizens pay for it in every way possible. 
233725	rational thinkers 
233755	supporting abortion 
233796	Can be too self righteous. They need to be tougher and smarter in strategizing all the misinformation that Republicans peddle. push media to fact check and call media on their ridiculous influence filled with personal opinions. I’m smart and just want facts. Give me information and trust that I can see the misinformation snd come to my own conclusions. 
233802	most of the actions the Democratic Party takes ends up being underwhelming in impact or a waste of taxes. 
233808	The way handling economy. 
233914	tends to believe that the government should be involved in everything, which isn’t necessarily the best solution 
233967	Sometimes idealistic policies, divided on the Middle East 
234020	pandering 
234026	The mainstream media has colluded to make them look good & hide all their lies & how awful they are doing. They speak negatively about Trump, when he is absolutely what the this country NEEDS. They put self interests ahead of what’s good for the American people, bc they hate America & want us to become a socialist country. If they win, all those who fought for our freedoms & gave up their lives, would be all for not. It will be a literal nightmare & I would want to leave the US. 
234032	spending out of control 
234044	in both parties there needs to be push for controlling spending 
234107	lack of backbone, economic policies, foreign policies 
234137	
234149	They just go with the status quo and it is more right leaning everyday. 
234173	They need to be more forceful to curb Israel's bombing of Gaza. They need to make sure that people are given opportunities to succeed with a safety net but not provide a life of support unless the person is disabled. They need to come up with better solutions for the homeless crisis - it is unrealistic to build everyone an apartment at taxpayer cost. 
234191	need to be more aggressive 
234197	Seem to want what's best for country; e.g., climate change, fair elections, rule of law, equality. 
234215	Overly influenced by wealthy donors. Passive in the face of unfounded attacks. 
234292	border, defense, economic policies 
234304	higher taxes to support un needed programs. 
234345	overall not forward thinking. trapped in old white man mentality 
234351	Too generous in handing out money to people. They are not fiscally conservative 
234405	everything except for abortion policies 
234480	Slow to act, too inclined to be moderate and get nothing done. 
234542	high taxes, government spending 
234595	Promote too much quality as a result violating the qual work equal pay , the basic economy science. Too much welfare reduces the country's economical competence and will eventually bankrupt the USA. Too many rules weaken America's military operation. 
234660	Democrats need to play on Republican's level. If they go low, Democrats should go lower. 
234672	Excessive spending.[CHAR(10)]Using my tax money on homeless[CHAR(10)]Using my tax money to keep the borders open versus closed[CHAR(10)]Using my tax money for their pet projects versus what I expect is roads, fair pricing on food, they are using my money by forcing businesses to raise wage rates which causes me to have to pay more but yet, I had to pay for college, my own car, my own food. Teach kids that food is more important that a Porsche. 
234678	Centralized government over states' rights. 
234713	They don’t fight back hard enough against conservatives/republicans. 
234719	There is some disconnections within some parts of the party. I also think they need to hear all voices and reflect on those who have legitimate concerns. Overall, they are united in the commitment to rid us of the scourge of Trump. 
234737	not progressive enough on any issue 
234749	they tend to be righteous in their beliefs without the empathy for folks that have only known republicanism and have had to look out for themselves as a way of life. it can seem shallow with empty promises 
234761	I feel there's always a reason why some items are not pushed through and not enough pressure or interest is added like we have seen with student loan Forgiveness programs, immigration reform, protections for the environment, abortion rights etc 
234779	sometimes you have to get dirty, just like the Republicans. 
234820	I don’t think I’ll ever vote blue again. inflation, crime and foreign policy has been terrible. People are making up genders and using excuses to get what they want instead of working for it. complainers 
234832	They seem to think they have solutions to problems that have money can supply. Look at the train wreck they call California. 
234844	I think they are realistic in their plans. They promise many things during the campaign but don't say how they plan to accomplish them. I think they are hypocritical and congress members vote for whatever the leadership says instead of representing their constituents. 
234862	Too much to list. The democratic leaders since the 70's have shown an unhealthy alliance with people that have socialist and communist leanings. They seem to be following Saul Alinsky's pattern to destroy America. I can't stand many of them: Clintons, Obamas, Pelosi, etc!!! 
234868	uncontrolled spending without regard to our country's needs 
234924	How are these politicians worth Millions of Dollars now they are in office. do we really pay them that much? 
234989	I think they make America look weak. I think they have horrible policies on Americans right to bear arms and I think that American should be able to live how they see fit and free but it should not be at the American tax payers expense in regards to trans, transabled, etc. I think they are idealistic in certain regards but prove to be weak and pandering to the masses that will vote. I also don’t believe in weakening our borders and allowing high value visa holders in. we should source our talent from within the states and ensure we are giving Americans jobs. 
235093	I don't like the fact that they want gay people to feel like they are normal when in reality being gay is a mental health issue, I also don't like the fact that they want the government to rule every aspect of our lives and make decisions for us without our consent. and last but most important I do not like their goal of implementing socialism into our democracy. 
235133	The one thing I don’t like is they agree to help those who are immigrants by offering government assistance and housing right after they entered the country. Then they forget to help those you have been living here for years and paying taxes. It all goes to those you just arrive. 
235139	We are too extreme as of late. I fall under that category too, and Im trying to fix that. 
235244	their free give aways to people that havent earned their way, and the philosophy of all inclusion 
235261	they are to conservative 
235273	Steps on our rights and the constitution. Always wants more Government programs involved in our lives. Soft on crime. Forced Mandates and Abortions for any terms. Wants children to switch genders and make our men weak. Gun Control 
235279	the way they are leading our country 
235292	weak on immigration, too concerned with being woke, activist culture on the left is very off putting 
235298	I wish they were stronger about defending their policies against Republican sabotage, inaction and dissent. 
235346	they are proaboration. 
235352	they like to spend money 
235377	I somewhat like how they generally try to make changes to policy and laws that seems to be done with the idea of helping and trying to understand a constantly evolving culture and society. 
235459	The Democratic Party doesn’t have a clear economic stand outside of taxing the wealthy. I agree that corporations and the ultra wealthy do need to be held responsible for their fair share of economic contribution, but they are not the sole solution to getting out of debt. The Democratic Party seems to rely too heavily on having the “moral” high ground and standing as the opposition to the republican party (specifically the Trump party) rather than standing on their own plan and believes. the party appears to change with the tide of what is popular in the news/social settings. I also do not support funding Israel. 
235607	lack of solid change 
235619	don’t have the backbone to implement programs with structure and rules, spend money they don’t have and never fix the problem, disproportionately supportive of extremely small populations, give everything away 
235660	While the party does look out for the less fortunate, it does affect those in the upper tier of income with more taxes. 
235725	everything especially the rat kamala harris 
235760	lack of holding the republican party accountable for anything 
235789	They need to be tougher on MAGAts who are traitors and need to be put in jail, or put to death. Trump, along with every GOP Senator or Congressman who participated in Jan 6th needs to be put in jail or executed. The Republicans are getting worse, and worse, as the decades go on, and only a tough stance will stop them from going full-on autocratic. 
235800	They are a little Liberal. 
235824	they also lie sometimes 
235835	fight for the individual[CHAR(10)]believe in Bill of Rights [CHAR(10)]proud of America 
235847	total disregard for Supreme Court decisions. excessive spending. open borders. war mongers. hypocrites. racists. 
235859	Their policies on abortion, immigration, energy, and education. 
235894	now for the American people; to interested in power and money and will exercise corrupt practices to get their way 
235911	far left pushing ideology. non patriotic, Marxist leftist agenda. climate change agenda. 
235921	anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, antisemitic 
235980	Most of them never tell the truth. 
236058	I selected this answer by accident. 
236067	lack of border control, usually don’t follow through with promises made during elections. 
236119	the peaple are uneducated and a crime family 
236161	not doing more for middle class 
236190	Economic policies, immigration, foreign pilicy 
236231	milquetoast cowards 
236272	I believe Freedom of choice is being erased by this party. I do not want or need to be told which car I will drive, what food I will eat, which appliances I can/cannot purchase, where I can or cannot live. I feel that this party is more supportive of the criminal rather than the general public. Actually, I totally dislike the extremes of both parties. 
236283	Too woke and soft on border and crime 
236289	pro abortion rights 
236295	Abortion, Immigration, Education, family 
236361	we still have a long road but i think the democratic party needs to work more on our country as far as betterment of Americans rather than other countries 
236367	spending too much 
236373	thier view on gun control 
236390	loans students, child care, college give to much money to low income. boarder 
236396	Their stance on immigration and gun control. They want the government to fix everything and not the people. 
236408	They are pushing gender ideology onto our kids. That is absolutely wrong. They control so many of the most powerfully influential institutes in the country such our our universities and the medical institutions. The democrats also push the narrative the white people are oppressors and people of colors are the oppressed. Not good for our kids. The republicans are wolves. The democrats are wolves in sheep's clothing. 
236419	Border policy too liberal 
236425	abortion 
236431	Not all pokiticians are transparent 
236437	taking away our freedom of choice 
236449	Disagree on social or environmental issues and them being the main points of importance currently. 
236460	too liberal, support gender change, support abortion, poor economy policies, loose border policies 
236496	Policies that pay out freely to non entitled persons.[CHAR(10)]Entitlement programs that add to the national debt. 
236501	Too much to list. I don't think they have a solid plan to get our economy (which they say is doing great, I disagree) growing again. I also believe they would work to take our 2nd amendment rights away. They are not handling the border crisis, they are not taking a stronger stand for Israel, our passive agressive stand against Vladimir Putin, legalizing killing babies, illogical handling of protecting the environment vs. providing affordable energy (gas, electric, wind, solar). 
236520	what is what I'm lost 
236654	abortion, crime, economy, and boarder policies 
236672	In this country that is already the most advanced and open in the world, the Democratic Party is too radical, especially in the illegal immigration and other genders besides men and women, which has cost too much American manpower and material resources. 
236797	stance on abortion and gun control. lack of impact on working class families that they claim to represent 
236839	- They are pro-murdering babies [CHAR(10)]- They allow children to mutilate themselves at such a young age[CHAR(10)] 
236912	The Democratic party has a way of alienating individuals in rural communities with socio-economic problems that serve as the voting base for Donald Trump. They can often come off as out of touch litists which further fuels his base. 
236970	Que son muy liberales 
237005	The defining characteristic of the leadership is that they are unmitigated lying Marxists hell bent on the destruction of this nation. The un of the mill Demoncrap is incapable of independent thought and simply regurgitates the shit he has been fed! 
237117	they are completely insane, they’re ideas and beliefs have gone off the rails 
237284	they tend to be all talk 90% of the time 
237296	Prices on gas and groceries tend to go up 
237330	they use us inmigrant for their agenda 
237353	immigration vetting process

237453	the attempt to give everyone a fair chance 
237495	gotten way too far left 
237524	The overwhelming corruption of members of the party holding office; elected or appointed. 
237553	IT APPEARS THAT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS A MONOLITH, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THOUGHT AND POLICY BETWEEN DIFFERENT DEMOCRATS 
237567	Some of them still cozy up to corporate interests. Instead of fighting for working people like they’re supposed to. 
237602	their unwillingness to codify Roe v wade, insider trading, using campaign promises to get elected and not delivering 
237626	more progressive views are needed at this point 
237638	their handling of the border 
237685	they go about solving problems the wrong way. student debt shouldn’t just be cancelled: they should be attacking the core problem of the predatory lending and skyrocketing costs of college[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]there are plenty of other examples similar to this 
237721	stand on border/immigration 
237780	Sometimes they seem to have no backbone. 
237792	SEE PREVIOUS ANSWER 
237835	They are too critical of others who don’t agree with them. 
237841	they cuddle the lower class too much. 
237853	economic views. 
237958	lack of sincerity on Foreign Affairs matters 
237999	illegal immigration 
238010	it is deeply disingenuous and most of them of them have forgotten or flatly rejected much of what is/was honorable about classic liberalism 
238026	Supporting war. 
238056	not as strong on immigration but not my most important issue 
238138	thinking that government knows best over our personal and professional behavior 
238143	the more radical left taking it over.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]the democratic party like republican is fractured 
238226	open border[CHAR(10)]immigration out of control 
238255	The overly-accommodating policies toward crime, and the persona of not having to work for things and the government simply giving you free money. 
238276	
238288	they lean on social issue stances too much 
238300	until Kamala, they were so divided that it was impossible to get anything done. I also feel like both sides have lost the ability to be bipartisan. Now nothing gets accomplished. The system is broken, and both sides are responsible. 
238306	they need to follow up on promises, and care for people of color or other less advantaged 
238312	too extreme and far to the left. there seems to be no middle ground 
238330	Here is an example. Allowing a transgender male use the females locker room in school because they feel more comfortable with that. But what about the comfort of the majority. The female girls. Why are they not taken into consideration as well. 
238336	The view that the opposition is eplorable has become ingrained. Given the MAGA machine that is perhaps understandable but at times there are voices within the opposition that we should listen to. 
238342	I think that sometimes their policies are aimed at convincing people they are victims. 
238371	They are too middle of the road, that keeps moving to the right. 
238407	Their values dont align with mine 
238413	Bad communication with Republicans 
238437	inability to work together with others 
238449	Liberal extreme woke policies, ideologies, foreign and economic policies, and efforts to remove God from people's lives. 
238498	The Democrats are not as organized or forward-looking as Republicans have been. 
238742	soft messages that end in compromise 
238760	They clearly would like to take our country back to a time prior to the Industrial Revolution. This seems to lead them to a more powerful situation removing power from the people. 
238775	i don’t believe they are as forthcoming as they should be 
238840	giving money and to much money. the wah they are handling the Border. the costs of living, housing, our foods, almost everything they are doing i dont like and yes it is affecting my life. 
238869	1) I feel there is corruption in the Democratic Party, just not as much as the Republican Party.[CHAR(10)]2) I do not like performative, political actions being done over actual problem solving. 
238881	Terrible language and communication skills. Too much focus on extremism rather than reality. Childishness abounds. 
238916	They spend too much money 
238935	There are a few who don't belong and should get out. 
238959	They are for the little people[CHAR(10)] 
239012	Too much encouragement to have the government take over control of everyone's life. 
239024	Abortion. I don't like abortion to be taken as a birth control method. 
239047	same as the Republicans, they need to get to work and stop the blame game and clean house. 
239071	They no longer support the citizens of the US 
239077	policies bad solutions to just about everything 
239113	that they seem to use main stream media to lie and deceive the American people about true facts, that and they are true hypocritesand bigots 
239119	Allowing illegal immigrants to take money that should be used the American citizens first. Pushing gender ideology and LBGTxyz. 
239125	The border, economy, crime, social issues, 
239166	spending is out of control. paying off student debt is ridiculous. the decision to go to school was made by them and the American people should not pay for it 
239275	I personally don't want them to allow undocumented immigrants to keep coming to the US 
239328	the agenda does not align with my values 
239334	Just like the Republican Party, they DO NOT properly prioritize working to raise the mean standard of living in this country. They are touting the stock market as an indicator of economic success, which is biased to favor the wealth class. They accept GDP as a measure of economic success, which is a poor measure. They have not dis-empowered the Federal Reserve Bank. 
239340	the extreme parts of the Democratic Party, 
239364	only that they all need to figure out how to work for THE PEOPLE not themselves.this comment applies to Republicans as well. 
239375	fiscal policies. covid policies. gender policies. dei policies. racism 
239393	they dont put Americans first. they are very much heir way or the highway and if you dont agree with them, you are a nazi. they want to put big government into small communities. And taking guns I do not agree with. 
239405	sleepy joe, talk in circles, give handouts, free everything. 
239417	I don’t like anything about it 
239454	becoming less open to ideas of others and willingness to compromise, that big ideas sometimes have to be implemented in steps and proven to have buy in from others, less willing to listen to what people want and need versus thinking they have all the answers 
239472	Having abortions after the baby is born is sickening! The cost of food, rent, and gas are disgusting! Go walk down San Francisco and see the blocks of homeless people struggling. Go to Colorado where people are being forced out of their homes. 
239489	all people need to work if they are able 
239519	the push of bidenomics that keeps inflation high 
239548	They want Government control, such as in Socialism or Communism. I don't like either of those. 
239634	I don't support gender altering surgery for minor, both private and public. I don't want the federal government to be in business of gender alterations in prisons. I do want the government to enforce gender affirmation in hiring, schools, and other public places and organizations. 
239646	1. lack of respect for Gaza [CHAR(10)]2. ultimately still aims to serve capital in this country instead of its constituents [CHAR(10)]3. no real progressive wing 
239675	no one cares my rent is too high and the cost of living is unmanageable 
239754	abortion policies, immigration policies, LBGTQ policies, economic policies- international policies-everything 
239771	Too liberal and don't like stand on gun control 
239777	they propse the complete wrong answer to the issues which generally support more division and separation 
239794	Sometimes I feel that the execution of many democratic politicians’ policies are economically impractical. 
239876	Very little commitment to prevent the Republican party from toeing the line of misuse of government to push unpopular policies. 
239899	That they used pressure in talking Biden from running; 
239952	immigration and fiscally irresponsible 
239976	Same as answered above for Republicans 
240006	Inaction on the border, not securing abortion rights 
240047	sometimes too far left 
240053	How they constantly move to the middle and right which places the middle on the right side gop side 
240065	more recent focus on social issues that alienate parts of the party base 
240089	Most things right now. Too extreme, too much emphasis on gender, behavior of political candidates 
240106	Their policies on economics, defense, abortion, education, & taxation. 
240136	each party has ones that are extremest. that’s what tears us down as a country.[CHAR(10)]we will never agree 100%. [CHAR(10)]when one party wins we are in the end the United States of America. 
240154	Too liberal. We need grass root business and strong work ethics. 
240165	absolutely everything 
240183	They say they are trying to help the middle class...yet they do nothing to help them. Most are just helping themselves 
240189	high taxes

311721	Inmigration, economical, foreign affairs. 
311929	Allowing too many peple in, they don't even care about immigration, they're letting people into this country and they don't care, they're taking our jobs and thinking they're better than us, they're trying to bring them in and having them do things they're giving them citizen and stuff and they might pull a fast one and get them to vote, they're pulling strings behind us, we'll find out in the voting what they do and how they cheat and don't think they won't do that, that's just my feelings, cuz I'm just [REDACTED] heading for [REDACTED] /AE/ Yeah I think they're against the constitution, guns, they want to strip everyone of their guns what they oughta say is get rid of the automatic weapons because they're causing too much trouble take away the big guns even the police if they took away the police they would still be fighting the big enemy and they're not for the police /AE/ I could go on and on but a lot more things that I... /AE/ I think they want to give our country... destroy our country in other words, in time, it's headed that way lets' put it that way, our country is weaker now, with foreign countries, a little bit but it's getting that way /AE/ Oh boy... No, I think that's it, I am a Democrat, but I haven't been lately 
311934	It seems like they're, they like the ladies /ae/ no 
312076	Their beliefs NO/ao/ 
312312	Yes, I feel like they are always talking about free money which everyone knows that there is no such thing as free money and it's going to come out of my income taxes, or federal taxes. I just feel like I'm going to end up paying it back somewhere. /AO/ Umm, there stance on free hand outs instead of giving people hand Ups and helping people sustain themselves. /AO/ No 
312325	I think that their very controlled by financial interests of donors who support them /AE/ I think they are not looking out for the voters /AE/ I think that's it 
312343	Yeah sometimes I think that they are slow to act. If especially if the action required is not considered progressive enough, I think sometimes that creates an obstacle. We should be doing more for ukraine. /AE/ No. 
312443	Control, how much control they want to have. I don't like big taxes especially when it comes to the middle class. I don't like their ideas on gun control. /AO/ Abortion, I do not like their stance on it. And i dislike their stance on free speech and moderation. Like Facebook and the news and how they moderate it. /AO/ NO 
313016	I JUST DONT LIKE THE WAY THEY GOVNER/NO 
313118	don't like a lot of their foreign policy and the way they spend money 
313693	afraid to act in defense of their own party. dont fight rep hard enough. need to fight rep harder. faster on daw 
314001	i think they are lying a lot and greedy pretending to not be greedy but they are, 
314024	sometimes they don't try hard enogu for the avrage american, like wages, home prices /ao/ no 
314130	i dont [particularly like how they have handled some of our foreign policy chaLLANGES i think sometimes they are ineeffective because they are unable to coalese around a strong agenda i dont always think that more goverment will solve the problems that we face i think both parties are extreme on that issue on the spectrum that is all for now 
314131	I think that they can be too extreme on the far left. I think some Democrats are ashamed of being Americans and they should be Patriotic. 
314172	It is my feeling that, they don't stand for the ethics and the principles this country was founded on, the work ethic, honesty, having a good character. I feel that when they go against someone, they'll play dirty tricks. So that's my feeling on the democrats. /AE/ No that covers it for me. 
314324	well the extreme left is promoting ideas I dont agree with like for children - gender reassignment and not letting parents know how they are identifing them self, i dont know i know there are people on the left that are protesting 
314336	Their views on gun control which is anti-second ammendment, their views on government programs, there's 17 different programs for aid like welfare, big spenders, they don't want to enforce existing laws, they just want to pass more laws, they're against personal freedom, to me it feels like they're concerned with your genetals and what you do with them. And in the democratic party a white anglo-saxon protestant, I'm seen as the root of evil in all of the world. The democrats think the world's problems can be solved with my money, my freedom, or my guns. If I give up enough of those that will take care of everyone's problem. Which is tragic because [REDACTED] /AE/ No, that should cover it. 
314425	the lack of concern for a majority of the interst of the american popuation ae/ not at this time 
314703	I feel like their organization is really corrupt. /AE/ No, that's the main thing. 
314803	I dont like the money; i dont like the immigrant situation/ae/no 
314956	Sometimes they don't say the things they should say that they mean, but they're not going against the party. /ao/ some of them are complacent. /ao/ No. 
315225	It's all fake. We live in a for-profit system where I don't have a belief that any of our votes matter and the parties are designed to divide us. /AE/ No. 
315284	high pharmacy costs, healthcare/ae/no 
315329	Not putting anything down. 
315330	I havent liked their candidates for several years. 
315625	I feel as though they are very much their way or the highway about some of their movements /AE/ No. 
315761	They're too left. They're just mean and hateful and it's so sad becase I used to have tons of friends and come to find out they're all left and they say mean things. I've known these people for 50 years, and no I hardly have any friends because I'm a republican. I have democrat friends calling me and telling me to switch parties. I was told you don't talk religion, politics, or money. /AE/ They don't love America and you can tell by their actions and they're letting our colleges be. And I'm so freaked out by the hate of Jewish people. /AE/ They don't mind killing babies. /AE/ Nope. 
315825	somethings are a little factions that are too far left too extreeme/they need to stop clutching their perals and reactionary/ao/no 
315921	Generally it's handling of the economy, it's soft approach to the economy that leads to high inflation. /AE/ No. 
315931	i think that both parties are not telling the truth on some issues /ae/ that's enough 
315948	they leaned so far the left socialism, they are not the party they use to be/ao/no 
315964	I guess specifically several members of the party and their affiliations or support of Hamas. /AO/ Yeah, umm although my understanding isn't 100 percent clear on this it would appear that the democratic party has an issue with insuring that our elections are secure by requiring ID to vote. /AO/ No 
315984	Govt spending/ae/lack of urgency on the immigration topic/ae/no 
316016	Um, let me think. I guess I don't like coziness with corporate america, or concensus on foreign affairs. Yeah I think that's it. /AE/ No. 
316123	It's what any political party has. There are some underhanded things that I don't agree with but that's just politics/ae/no 
316169	I feel like, they don't have our best interestes in minde, the working class I'm wokring class you know I dont think they have my best interests in mind. /AE/ Yeah I don't like how they brought Kamala in without anyone's opinion right? Anyone like us, I mean that's not normal. /AE/ No. 
316227	i dont like the way the handle immigration at all/ao/ and they were not the greatest on the economy/aono 
316234	I wish they would speak up more /AO/ no 
316243	I think they are being too diplomatic and stop about thinking about reelection some of them not all and get back to the job of taking care of the people as much as they can given the current makeup. 
316251	The fact thta they encourage reliability on government. Made possible by FDR, the ponint was the help people who needed help, almost everytime now, especially illegal immigrants are getting the benefits. She hears a lot of US citizens that cannot get benefits form the government but the illigal immigrants get the benefits /AE/ Not valid but heard that the Democrats are responsible for people being gay but not true, the democrats are making room for who they want to be (wouldn't be a minus she says) /AE/ No 
316326	Border policies not doing it right, way too many people come in, we have people that don't even have jobs here that we're giving their jobs, its costing us too much money to fly these people in from other countries, put them up in hotels, give them free food, place to stay. Wouldn't mind if lower number but bringing them in by the thousands /AE/ No 
316385	They lack fiscal sensibility. /AE/ I don't like that they push their social ideology and agenda on other people. /AE/ That's it. 
316400	I think they've gone too far left. 
316434	Lie and crooket, cant trust them. I DK if there is anything better than that. 
316600	They give away to much free stuff don't make you work for whatever you accomplish and want to be in your business. They make a person become lazy and depended on free stuff. They never did her any favors 
316605	its disorganized, and ineffective at communicating /ao/ leave it at that. 
316747	I am not 100% that's why I gave them 60, I can see sometimes the president brings an issue and his own party fight him on all that, 
316805	Sometimes their lack of focus/AE/ cant think of anything. 
316937	aveces es muy tibio, aveces no lo defiende con durez, 
316949	Their economic policy /AE/ Push for green energy /AE/ Rhetoric /AE/ No 
317151	Again, this is my opinion. The deceptiona nd lying, that's what I believe okay? I believe other things too, if they win the election they'll cheat to win the election. I think the last time, I don't believe that Joe Biden actually won the last election, I don't believe it, a theory, I'm a skeptic. /AE/ Not that I can think of. 
317447	Yes, they don't go about the social stance correctly. I think they, socially they cripple those in need and keep them needing and dependent on the system. And, I feel like it is on purpose to control that crowd. /AO/ NO 
317777	They're more for themselves than the people./ae/no 
317858	how much they are willing to give for welfare/ae/ no 
317863	Social issues, border issues, green energy crap, world things, like the issues with Israel right now, not amused right now, just hateful, they're just hateful. I am a registered Democrat by the way /AE/ abortion issues, just horrific /AE/ the social issues, the gender crap, hostility towards religion, there's a lot of things in my personal life that would make it seem like I would be more of a democrat, but no thank you, not anymore, dishonesty would be one of the top issues they lie about everything /AE/ No, I could probably spend 2 hours on it but I'll let it go with that 
317877	Its the way that everything has been manipulated in the Trump regime. McConnell and Trump and the Supreme court that should have never happened. 
318059	progressive anture, focus on mangining the americans lives as oposed to what benefits us as a comminity, baidicslly they think they have the only answrs and our thoughts are immiterial 
318308	they care too much about people and society. outline need to keep cutting off. they dont see what they are trying to do. kind off, they have their agendaAE/no 
318365	They lie. They just say what they think what people want to hear but they won't do it. 
318480	Their leanings on the economy and abortion and the way they are handling things with Israel and the border. 
318675	The fact that they want to put govt controls on everything. /AE/ Just the people who are participating in those policies to control everybody. /AE/ No 
318735	I don't like the fact that Joe Biden is not the one really running our country. I believe that Obama and perhaps the Clintons are actually controlling the decisions that should be made by our president. I know for a fact that the Clintons have actually carried out threats against others who were against their decisions when they were more directly involved with the government. 
318786	How permisive they have become in their alliship of israel and how they are suporting the genocide against palistine.....spending a lot of our hard earned tax paying dollars on creating bombs and warefare when we could be using that money here at home feeding our kids and our homeless and lesser to do people. /ae/no

320953	Too forward thinking in small factions of any issues ,moving too fast in social progression, A/E No 
320966	I don't like the ultra liberal side of the Democratic party. /AE/ No that's enough. 
321089	Most of their focuses like what was it the green plan I'm trying to think of the stupid plan they had a few years ago. I don't like their health plan because now my insurance went up, the working poor pays more /AE/ Just I feel like a lot of focus on things people can do on their own like transgender, I feel like now there's such a big focus on it /AE/ No 
321149	I don't like that they, I don't want to say that they give out handouts, how do I explain this without sounding horrible, I don't like that they make things too easy like in San Francisco and in California in general. /AE/ That's it 
321154	They just they seem to have a lot of marxist ideology right now. /AE/ Stand on abortion, tax policy. That's enough, energy policy, I mean. America's sitting on the richest oil reserves just discovered recently, and their policy is o don't drill the oil Put up solar panels that you gotta buy from china. /AE/ No. 
321345	their policy on immagration/much of the economy/ the newe proposed medicare for all/the neew green deal/ao/no 
321750	that they don't go after their goals with the same passion Republicans do /AE/ the consistent claims to change things for the better and ending up usually just being worse /AE/ no

321882	How they're handling the rights of individual people 
322018	Government spending but it doesnt make a diffence at this point. Generally just spending and taxes and gun reform. 
322068	i just dont agree where they are taking this county/ao/no 
322464	Immigration, the giveaways, spending taxpayer money foolishily, the economy /AE/ No 
322509	I don't like their stance on immigration and I don't like their stance on welfare. Democrats want to give away money like it's water. /AE/ No. 
322529	i wish they were a little more that i'm not anti-immigration, a little stronger on immigration, more on military, wish they did a little more with the economy and bring it in control, wish they'd be a little more willing to work across party lines 
322864	Yeah when they go way to the left. Like, Bernie Sanders. That kind of throws me a little. I really not, I know so many people that are on welfare that play the system in this town, and I know too many people who apply for disability. And they're perfectly strong and get disbility. That is what I disapprove of. /AE/ No. 
322982	They also lie a good bit. /AE/ I don't like the way they handle things sometimes, like Nancy Pelosi, and some of the other people. I can't think of their names. /AE/ No. 
323181	Abortion/ae/no 
323222	too progressive policies

323687	That they cheat too. After I found out that Debbie Wasserman Shulz gave the question to Hillary Clinton before the debate. I don't like that. They cheat too. they are not above the right. 
323707	they are liars, they hate America and they want to guve it away; and they dont care about the citizens and taxpaers; and they proore bizaar and hurtful policies; and they lean communist; 
323876	they've gotten better but try to place nice with extreme on other side instead of going that with them, calling them out, like Michelle, they go low,we go high /ao/ that's it. 
324034	Too much government interference, They want control of peoples lives with keeping people relient on federal aid. They are pushing a socialist government which I'm definately against. They've allowed criminals to come across the border. More drug issues with the open borders. Out of control inflation. People needing to work more than one job to make ends meet. They don't support police, crime is out of control in these sanctuary cities. Increase in homelessness. I feel like we lose the pride of the being an American with the Democrats. 
324165	the favor the rich and powerful/ao/no 
324356	Generally speaking I don't like their policies on abortion, I don't like the way they handle immigration. I'm not a very political person as you can tell. /AE/ No

327292	It is too quick to fund a solution that may not work, it is trending too far to the left, it is not provided the outstanding candidates that we need. 
327329	I don't like how the immigration situation is being dealt with, I believe we have been bringing too many people in and not being able to provide fully for the people that have been here/ae/no 
327514	Their politicians. /ae/No. 
327543	I feel like they're pro immigration, like they want immigrants into the united states, whereas the republicns are more against illegals. At least from my point of view it seems like the democrats want illegal immigrants. /AE/ Nope.

328240	i know theres alot of talk about immigration and talk abou our borders being ope, from an outsiders perspective, theres got to be a better way to help others in need, while still protecting those who live here; Im not sure they have the right plicies at this point;

328506	They don't tell thr truth. And they're making too much out of the minor gender issues. And they're letting too many illegal immigrants into the country. /AE/ No. 
328537	I don't like how they think that everybody is entitled to a free ride, i don't feel they give working people the proper benefit of working, it seems like that those who don't work benefit more than those that do work 
328683	Immigration policies. Israel right now. /AE/ Helping Ukraine /AE/ 
328812	Well you know the definiton of democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. We are not a democracy we're a Republic. /AO/ No just in general. They are leaning towards socialism. /AO/ No

330021	repeated failures in execution ae/ i think speaking to that they are disorganized ae/ they seem ineffective ae/ no thats it 
330139	I think they're corrupt, I think the president and his son should be in prison for treason and espionage. /AE/ I think the entire white house and everyone in it should be removed and replaced with new people. I think Democrats should remember this is a democracy and put their hand across the isle and play ball rather than fight everything. That's it. 
330186	I think their failure to follow through on some of their more well-intentioned policies, and I'm probably slightly more left of them in my political tendancies. /ae/No. 
330331	Don't care for the party to him puts the needs of the few in front of the needs of the many. This country was based on a Republic, for the people, the majority, Democrats want to give all this transgender crap, everybody can get their sex changes and all the rest of that. Had to deal with it when her daughter was in public school, children don't know what that is, teacher's and staff shouldn't be teaching that, girls are girls and boys are boys Democrats like. Has Democratic friends, some are very liberal, no such thing as govnt free cheese, don't beileve in all the handouts.

330648	se quedan muy callados; 
330767	I find them to be very inaffective in their communications with the general public. They often seem to be on the defense against the republican party. And they fall into political traps which kills their overall ability to show the american people what they are doing, what they stand for, who they are. /AE/ I dont believe that they do enough when it comes to the important policies needed in the united states that they claim to what to help with.

331180	The modern party, their immigration policies which includes their border policies. their monetary policies which includes their tax policies. Their Energy policies which includes the new green deal policies. Their supreme court policies, which includes packing the supreme court via Roosevelt 1936. Abortion policies, which includes unfettered abortions even up to the time of birth. /AO/ Oh, hold on. Their civil rights policies. And thiei voting rights policies. Which would include their opposition to the SAFE Act. /AO/ no 
331265	How they seem condescending and how they seem fake. They just seem very fake. /AE/ Nah I guess that's it. 
331304	There's a lot of talking and not much action, and a lot of times I feel they, they look like and act like Republicans in that sense /ae/ no. 
331503	condoning everything, but knowing people and police defunding which is very crucial they RE OK FOR CITIZENS TO OPOSE POLICE WHICH IS THE Main reasson why RE Ntion is flling apart, they are very soft on crime, LLOWING CRIMINALS TO GET wY WITH MURDERS AND RAPES WHICH IMMIDIte stop and must end.ae/ overALL THEY are poluting OUR SOCIETY, AND BRAINING WASHING PEOPLE WHICH MUST BE PUT TO AN END/AE/ YOU CAN'T CONDONE FOR WHt god said has forbidden and the democratics are dibliberating so/ae/ is your born S mN OR FEMle you should love god for it and embrace him for being healthy, democrats instead emphSIZE YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO CHOOSE YOUR GENDER/AE/OUR NATION MUST WAKE UP/AE/THAT'S IT AND as fR AS CRIMES PUNISHMENT SHOULD FIT THE CRIME, THERE IS NO WAY A MURDER/RAPIST SHll receive mitigTED SENTENCE FOR WHt they did and thAT'S WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING/AE/ 
331565	Their crass ideas of trying support defund the police, which, yeah you got your bad eggs in the image department, they should have better screening on them. Don't get rid of the police, they're protecting evreyone and they're trying their best. /AE/ Their situation with trying to keep bringing in immigrants. Doesn't mater what country but, can we please have a vetting system and not give them this that and the other thing, and they're telling their relatives they're getting the good stuff. And they keep coming over. /AE/ No. 
331714	You don't like the game, we need the democratic billionaires to beat the republican billionaires, and I just wish we didn't need billionaires. 
331834	THey want money 
332094	i think they give too many freebies for people that don't work, and i don't think they take a strong enough stand on immigration 
332687	To me they are not doing as much as they are saying and as they are supposed to they say a bunch of things and they dont imporove our situation and out economy. /ao/ thats it 
332721	their pro choice/their stance aon immagration/ao/no

333335	the willingnees to help other people and they are putting their before americans 
333344	A lack of follow through, but that's not the word. /AE/ Inconsistancy in their stances. /AE/ NO 
333458	They have gotten away from working towards helping the working class famlies. They are unwilling to work with the republicans to make life better for working class people. 
333687	There's nothing..I find them to, the loudest part that politicians pander too, i find them to be dishonest. I think they would do anything for power, I don't think they care about any of us. I think that is why all the people in that party that I found respectable have walked away. And I think that all of the policies that they try to push are inflamatory but for the most part wildly unimportant. What I was trying to say is they keep pushing all of their policies towards the loudest part of the party, their constituants as it were. They pander to activists and do not worry about what the average people have to deal with day to day. I also think their rehtoric is boring, unimanginative, repetitive and kinda gross. /AO/ No 
333718	I don't like that they are pro-abortion and I don't like that they print money like its tap water. They to are out to fulfill their own agenda and not the agenda of the people. 
333756	I don't like neoliberal politics/ae/I don't like when they ally with corporations/ae/no 
333773	I feel they dont care about the middle calss and protect our oney they want to give it away to people who are not necessarily working for it. 
333861	they could be a little vmore fprceful/ao/no 
333889	their decisions / ae /no 
334064	a little bit of everything/ao/no 
334077	it seems to me that they are not honest with the people, they are no longer with the people, 
334153	they do everything in the wrong direction, they don't agree with anything and everything that the republicans say 
334509	I don't like any of their positions or policies that they stand for and to them compromising means giving it all to them /AE/ I don't like teir stance on immigration, abortion and lack of fiscal responsibility. /AE/ I don't like the candidates that are running for president and vice president /AE/ I think that's enough. 
334591	They are a little, they've moved towards the center and they are a little beholdent to wall street. 
334700	I think they're soft /ao/ that's pretty much it. 
334801	Everything/AE/no. 
334817	the way the manipulate the media/ae/hipocrisy/i think they tried to kill Mr Trump twice./ae 
334823	Sometimes I think they need to be a little more aggressive with opposition. 
334906	i odnt quite agree with how they treated bernie sanders in the past i wish they would have given him more support when he was running/ao/i also wish the dems would be a bit more aggressive in their tactics when it comes to campaigning and connecting with the us population/ao/no 
335043	representation having younger people involved if you are able to join military between 18-39 yrls old and if you are able to represent this party at that age yo ushoud be able to represent the country at that aga as well. 
335208	Well recently they've kind of fixed it. I feel sometimes they get in their own way. They don't take risks, they don't react quickly to situations. And up until recently they haven't been really good about addressing bullies. /AE/ No 
335285	they don't answer questions that are asked, they beat around the bush. and what they state is not true//ao// that's it 
335388	Abortion policy and general handling of money. A/E No 
335445	how they are handling the isreal palistine conflict 
335580	They are trying to push fake news and an agenda to try and control the country/ae/no 
335760	We don't have enough time. Primarily their social agenda, and we'll dig into that in a little bit. Their stance on abortion, with little or no controls; their willingness to push woke ideology; their willingness to promote racism through backing socialist organizations such as Black Lives Matter; (I've got to look up the term): their willingness to support Critical Race Theory; their soft on crim stance; their willingness to look the other way while illegal aliens pour into this country; I'm going to rephrase that: the way that they have created an environment that promotes the increase of illegal aliens crossing into the United States and remaining here; their attack on manhood and womanhood - and I'll further explain that - their unwillingness to define what a man is and what a woman is; their promotion of man and women's sports; their ideas about globalism. To expand on that: creating an environment that weakens the United States position on the international stage, militarily and financially. I think we'll stop there. 
335788	They are not helping us they are againt us 
335830	Currently I do not like how they are engaged in multiple wars over seas/and I dont like the talk of people voting without valid ID/AO// 
336173	They are for an expanisive government, higher taxes, much better at manipulating than the Repubican party/ae/A lot of policy positions that i disagree with./ae/no 
336184	I am concerned about the position on abortion although I don't have a resolution for it..I'm not sure where to go with it. Ummmm, I am also concerned about their position of third world countries, especially countries that are dealing with famine, and internal strife. I am also concerned about their slightly imbalance toward their position between Israel and Palestine. 
336278	Again I think it comes down to the individual that represents the stance and the party. There are some things that I feel I like less because I'm more conservative. /AO/No 
336325	I'm a gay man, they used the gay community, everything ethnic group but they didn't do anything for them 
336728	I think that sometimes the democratic party is too dependent on what we might call ostal elites and the party doesent always think about building support from all parts of the country. A/e 
336818	I don't like that they don't empasize that you must find a way to give back to this earth. You can't just use the resource and try not to give something back//ao// he would does not work doesn not eat unless you are handicapped in someway//ao// I guest the fact that abortion should be on demand as a convient factor, I think it's very wrong//ao// I never see a plan to even try to pay back our national debt that will soon econ. overwhelm our country. I don't want to hear what they are spending it on, I want to hear what they are going to cut//ao// that's enough 
337080	dont like stance on what done border, not protecting people, border patrol, something better could have been done. economy, wars w/russia. funnel so much money to other cntries, not enough focus here. democrats dont really care, gas was expensive, groceries 
337094	They are still politicians/ae/no 
337211	politicized/AE/don't trust them/AE/no 
337374	i agree that people can find there having wanting to be idified in the world, I think in sport competion , I think individuals that have reached pubety a a male should not be allowed to compete with against females regardless of their current testerone levels 
337421	Facilitated genocide even though both parties have done that, liars even though both parties are, suspicious /AE/ Their alliance with Isreal /AE/ No 
338080	probably over spending and overtaxing /ao/no 
338306	the border problem 
338347	acting slow on immigration, not being forceful enough related to open Supreme court seats/ae/certain Dems going against ISrael/ae/wild Policies from the far left, appointing an atty general who acted very slowly against cases related to the former president Trump 
338419	Stances on health care and current foreign policy/ae/immigration policy as well./ae/no 
338430	they want the borders open. they want to take away everybodys guns/ae/ they are sending Millions of dollars to foreign countries that are not our allies. which is causing Inflation/ae/they're using taxpapyers Money for illegal Immigrants who are flooding the country/ae/no[CHAR(13)][CHAR(10)] 
338443	i don't like the way they promise things and then don't do the the things, and then when election time comes they say they're going to change things, but they didn't change things last time around 
338533	They get in their own way with their policies, they can't seem to execute what they say they can execute. I was very participatory in the election process until I saw how it actually kind of works with the last couple election cycles partucularly with the last few primaries. I was a huge Bernie Sanders fan whether or not he could have gotten done what he said, but then he got railroaded. I thought I would have loved for him to be president but then he got pushed out of the primaries b/c the party didn't think he would be electable and thats where the turn started for me. 
338645	their spirits are jot that high for voting 
338934	border secutiry issues, abortion, sex changes for criminals, making high school girls compete against male hormorne grls, 
338937	they can be misleading and ther's also some division thers and somtime the peolple in the party are more moderate 
338939	Its still unfortunately making decisions based off of corporate power and struggling to go about any real change . 
338976	Too liberal, sometimes polarized, sometimes more emotion-based decision making versus logic and ration-based decision making. /ae/ No. 
339072	Trying to figure out how to word this... thier policy shift over the last 20 years is completely opposite of where they started from /AE/ Yes, their incessive determination to flood our country with illegal immigrants from the border and they have no care about it /AE/ Their insistance on political correct language how easily they're offended that you don't use it /AE/ That'd be it 
339331	Represent Marxism 101/ae/no. 
339335	Stance on abortion, stance on transgender issues, their stance on the border, their stance on guns, gun control, their berating of law enforcement /AE/ No 
339452	They are to extreme with everything they do. a/E no 
339478	their socialist views, their socialist economic policies /AE/ their ultra liberalism where their hard left so to speak /AE/ no 
339506	their policy on the war in gaza/ae/they tend be ineffective with good ideas but I dont see alot of change happening /ae/ no 
339666	It's kind of the same things I said about Kamala. Don't agree on their abortion views, the way they handled the border, foreign policy, money being given to other countries, how they handled the hurricane in North Carolina, the economy. /AE/ No. 
339808	Poor budgeting, I feel like money goes to things that aren't a pressing concern. /AE/ No. 
339850	I think that we need to stop pussyfooting around people's feelings. I feel like the Democratic party is always trying to please everybody/ae/no 
340121	I think they have become more controlling, less supportive of first amendment rights. Their woke idealogies have gone over the cliff as far as I'm conceerned. One thing that is probably big for me is 2nd amendment rights and that's never set right with me. /AE/No. 
340249	yes i dislike both parties economics of bot parties/ao/no 
340828	they get too radical at times and obsessed with identy 
341028	The whole thing. I don't agree with any of it. /AE/ no 
341414	Ijust wish they would stand up and fight for the Democratics more instead of giving in a lot easier to the Republicans. that they let a lot of things get by and we need somebody to stand up for us and they are not representing us appropriately 
341439	Follow the money. 
341524	They tend to push to be a little more moderate to be more paletable for the general population. I don't think that we need moderate in this country at the moment so I don't like that. /ae/Not right now. 
341749	I DONT LIKE THE WAY THEY PICK THEIR CO=ANDIDATE THIS YEAR/ I DONT LIKE THAT THEY DID NOT A HAVE A PRRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIN AND THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE THRU THE PROCESS BY THE american people should have ahd a choice of who thy are foing to pick/ao/no 
341784	I think that Democrats want us to pay way too many taxes. /ae/ No 
341794	just don't like the way the country has been run by the Democratic party, as far as the economy and the way the Covid was handled, that really hurt our country, I mean that's changed it forever /AE/ like I said just their overall decisions that they've made have not been good for our country /AE/ I guess that's good enough 
341865	their views on abortion, gun control, the amount of handouts they give or advocate for, their attacks on the wealthy when it comes to tax policy, they don't see to be too business or corporate friendly AE some of their policies on gender identity that sums it up. AE no, that's good for that one 
341916	They don't stand up for the American people good enough, the lower class people those with less money, they stand up for the rich people /ao/ no

342520	sometimes I think they are too lax about enforcing justice amoung crime fighter, policeman, judges and lawyers//ao/ that's it 
342539	they don't protect the borders, they celebrated open borders, celebrate abortion, devalues the right to life, they're divisive. they're main goal is to stop DT, not the good of the country, there are several members that are extremists, they look to take away 2nd ammendment rights, high government spending, no fiscal responsiblility, insider trading, their foregin policies have been nonexistant, they allowed aphghanistan withdrawal failure, where too many service 13 members died, and they left equipment which is now in the hands of Iran, they've pushed the political witch hunts for DT, and made up indictments, targeting lawfare against a political opponent 
342690	dont think they go far enough, promises unkept, usually propolicing 
342720	at one time i thought they were for the middle class, but i have come to realize that is not the case. This question is in reverse with the other about what is liked and not liked 
342810	Pace and slow. 
343051	the fact that they are too free on something, they should be more careful no to be so given, and more restritions and more careful about the things they approved / ae / no 
343215	They cripple the non working party, the support they give to the non working party AE 
343223	I don't agree with their immigration policies. /AO/ I don't know if it matters but part of that has to do with a personal family thing. My neice met someone online who lives in another country and she wanted her to come here to visit, and it took more than a year for her to get a three week visa to come and visit. Well that was just last year, so it's kind of a recent thing and she is trying to get her a permit to come here and live because they are going to get married and she still hasn't got to. So she has jumped through all the hoopes and she still hasn't got approved. It's not fair. All these people can just come on over and they are denying her to come here. I just don't understand that. /AO/ no 
343288	 Its views on abortion. Its criticisms of the Supreme court. Excess spending. 
343512	they're pro abortion, they're not fiscally responsible 
343651	What is there to like? /ms/ our borders are open, crime is through the roof, we're giving millions, billions to other countries, and only 750 dollars to our hurricane victims, which is ridiculous /ae/ no 
343703	Everything they stand for. A/E The border issues, abortion, Gender Id issies. A/E No 
343797	they pretend to be for the little peopl,they talk from both sides of the mouth, they way to the left and I dont belive the country is that far to the left, I dont apreciate the woke of the party, and the accomodatation that all have to make for a small group of people. 
343884	I think that as inclusive as the Democratic Party is with the LGBTQIA+, they also are promoting it tochildren which I do not agree with. 
343894	at the state level that have too much power in Illinois, it's not true in Illinois, there's a difference between the state level democrats and the national democrats. In terms of gerrymandering and truly ensuring that the elected officials represent the population and providing equal voting access, on a lots of issues i'm further left than the democratic party 
343910	It's supposed to be big people and little government and it's not and the democratic party exasperates that /ae/ No 
343932	I think they also have alot of corporate interests and they are slow to act when they have a majority/ae/ 
343994	like the Republican party it can be very partisan when it comes to certain issues /AE/ sometimes not willing to compromise /AE/ no 
344010	I don't like how they can get particularly extreme in some regards due to maybe public influence, or um social media influence. Other than that, no. /AE/ Not at all. 
344206	I don't like the way they do things, they're always hiding behind somebody. /AE/ No that's about it. 
344207	I feel that the democratic party likes to keep people on the plantation. They have set up a welfare state so that people who have to get help from the government become dependant on the government and dont set people up for success. The democratic party likes to spend money that we dont have./Ao/ They make bad policies/AO/ No 
344251	I thnk sometimes the D party tries to push isssues that doesnt need to be push , its pushed to soon/ae /no 
344295	Sometimes they're too progressive. /ae/In general, goes back to foreign policy, in general, I feel their foreign policy is lacking--they're too progressive. I think at the federal level, foreign policy is very important, not saying they shouldn't do domestic work, but I do believe that a lot of domestic work belongs to local and as long as funding flows from federal to local, local government can take care of local issues better than federal can. /ae/Goes back to them being progressive, sometimes I feel the democratic party they're not as solid. They don't give off a sense of foundations and principles that Republicans might have. /ae/ No. 
344307	I don't think they are for the middle class. /AE/ no 
344332	a lot of middle of the ground stances /ao/ trying to get everyone on the same page when it's just not always possible /ao/ that's it. 
344826	They don't always tell you the truth. They tell you one thing, and then they don't do it. 
344977	i trhink the democraticd party could be more agressve in their party and they can become more ruthless and the democratic party holds back and it hobbles them because the republican party does alot of underhanded stuff/ao /no 
345194	I don't agree with their stance on Immigration. How they are spending the United States money or abortion. /AO/ Well so, there are things like when I watch the debates, there are things I see that I can think, I can see their position, I can't think of specifics, but there are things I can see their stance. I just don't agree with their over all position. /AO/ NO 
345337	They never follow through. If they ever get power in congress and house, they just, there's always a couple people who turn and nothing ever gets passed. /AE/ I guess corporate lobbying. I'd also say media but also that's just media on both sides. Democrat media is sickening in the same way. They rose with Biden for so long when everyone knew he was demented, he could barely run office. It's like grandpa. Then they all of a sudden change him for Kamala. They follow whatever narrative was passed down. It's not objective reporting, every story has to have some emotional narrative. They want you to be upset. /AE/ Nah. 
345364	They put themselves on a high horse and I guess what I mean by that is um they are the opposite of the Republican party and so there is no true medium anymore. /AE/ Nope. 
345378	when they go too far left, when they go so extreme. /ae/ no 
345491	well the rich is for rthe rich which is democrat ita not working out right not that i have a sayao/no 
345802	yeah I dont agree with all of the decisions or positions from democratic party members, I their position on international involvement in war, I oppose that, Im fairly pacifist, I sometime wish I had another option beside democratic party, on this thermomenter, I think I said 65%, its a little bit in the feeling category more than the fact category my reason or the things I dont like about the emocratic party/ae/nothing else comes to mind 
345806	I don't anything abou their policies. They have none other than abortion and open borders. /ao/ that's enough. 
345831	I would like it if we had an effective third party system but i dont think our numbers can do that im not sure if they can./ AE/NO 
345922	Occasionally unrealistic expectations /AE/ Don't always sell ideas well /AE/ No 
346089	I don't know how to put this delicately, they need to toughen up a little bit, they're a bunch of pussies right now. They pushed joe biden out which i approve of and put kamala harris in there. Over the last couple election cycles, we see the same type of setup happen and we lost every time. Even with biden it was so close we barely got it in. We've come to the point where we need to play it dirty a little bit, don't hate the player hate the game, we need to protect democracy. They certainly aren't being nice about it. /AE/ No. 
346091	Just that they were more moderate and too extreme now. /AE/ No. 
346093	their fiscal policies/ae/no 
346116	i think a lot of those people are getting too old and are getting out of touch, i still think they care more 
346251	I think they are little weak willed/AO// 
346443	in fighting that's lead to weakness, not strong enough in criticism or condemnation of Republicans. They did not condemn when they had the chance, instead let Joe Biden play it out. /ao/ their hesitancy /ao/ that;s it. 
346515	I don't think they play dirty enough or as dirty as the republicans /ao/ nope 
346628	I feel like they could be doing more, for example gun control. /ae/ It just, how do I say, it just feels that when things are passed there's a lot of concessions that need to be made and it still doesn't tackle the main issue. /ae/ That's it for now. 
346629	I think they ve gone too far left. they are too extreme/ae/ I dont like how they handled covid/ae/im against their abortion Policy 
346848	The Democrats want control of the house so much that they push their agenda without revere for others choices. 
346911	well we do a lot of arguing among ourselves, Bernie Sanders Joe Manchin and some of the liberal , the far left gets a little carrie daway however with Jiapol (sp?) leading that caucaus it seems to be less radical, you cant shove progressive ideas down the throats of people you get a reaction, you have to educate and ease and compromise/ae/ i dont think so 
347066	their stance on a lot consitutional rights, particular sensorship, gun rights, religious freedom, criminal jusctice, and abortion, foreign policy. 
347261	Its hard to get things done sometimes, they need to get theyre stuff together. They are not progressive enough. 
347406	they have almost missed an opportunity with this years presidential electrion and that has since improved and getting some od hteirs laes passed to help with change/ao/no 
347472	I feel like they might force some americans to accept ideas that do not align with their beliefs. /ao/ No 
347580	Spending our money /AE/ Their abortion stance /AE/ No 
347603	they are ruining the country AE that pretty much sums it up, economy, everything, border, immigration, it's all included. 
347759	Sometimes they're wimps/theres time when they havent shown enough backbone/i'd like to see more slings and arrows towards Trump and his ilk/Michelle Obama says &quot;they go low we go high&quot; but theres sometimes that need to be addressed/AO// 
348052	They spend too much money as far as pumping up the national deficit. And they don't correlate with my views on a lot of different thinks. /AE/ I think that's it 
348423	The progressive views on human sexualtiy. i believe in loving everybody but ...I believe human sexuality is not just genetic. There are other factors such as nature and nurture/ae/I do want to support Ukraine and I'm not sure the democrats will be supportive of that...and not the Repuclicans either/ae/no 
348758	they atre spinless when it comes to the minorities they have left and abandoned minorities, black and brown lgbt community/ watching the abortion and joe biden being mentally gone its heroing for a young person in this county/ao/no 
348761	I just don't like how they uh deal with the situation of the immigrants/AE/ no

350963	I dont have anything against. It seems like their liberal policies doesnt really effect the country in the direction that we shuld be going. I have a bunch. They spend so much money on stuff that we have to come back and pay for it and they waste so much time. And Im not racist or anything I dont care if you wanna get married to your buddy but we shouldnt be wasting money that is personal and should be between you and God. Telling our children if they wanna be a bot or girl. They are just wasting too much time and money. I might get in troble for my opinion but. /ao/ Their border they ae letting in people who dant respect our country and burn our flag. Im not agains immigration but do it the right way. We dont know if they are coming to harm us. They are giving them money and outting them in hotels. Do it the right way. We are a melting pot of people and we need good ones. They dont even take care of their own. We have poor people and old people here that needs help. Heathcare, cant afford their prescriptions. We dont have the jobs that we should. Our infrastructure is failing, roads and bridges, we should have some of the best roads in the world. And I dont know if thats an answer or not.

I know te pandemic hurt the country /ao/ this new green deal, Im not against the new green deal and I do believe in protecting our envirinment our water and air but to force it all on us it should be gradually phased in. ao/no 
351238	I don't really like their stance on abortion. I don't approve of abortion but I feel it is up to the individual choice. I don't approve of gay marriage. I understand why they did it but I don't approve. 
351535	I'm a bit concerned with their hesitancy to confront head-on the threat that Donald Trump is as strongly as I feel it needs to be addressed /ae/ No. 
351859	They're a bit soft in pushing policy and getting things done, they need to be a bit more aggressive. /AE/ That's really it.

352166	Some of them need to retire and let some young blood in there and school them as well. There's a lot of them that need to give up some seats and I know that's hard to do. /AO/ Umm, it's okay to still try to run the world but, look at it this way. When you first got in office you wanted to make a change and not to much things have changed, so yes, let someone have an opportunity to change it. /AO/ No 
352264	The view on the economy and not runing it more as a business. I'd like more help inside the states, such as naturak disaster funds./ae/no

352953	I don't like their abortion policy. I dont like that they keep saying the know the middle class is hurting and the economy is hurting but they havent done anything about it 3 years. And I'm tired of them blaming Trump for all the problems they should have straightened out. /ae/no 
353269	iguess they are policuies are noy what ai subscribe to/ao/no 
353415	The past 2 elections they haven't seemed to be able to produce very strong candidates. I guess a correction to that would be 2016 and 2020. I think 2024 Kamala is a good candidate. /AE/No 
353659	They do not stand for the American people at all, they've opened the borders up, they stopped building the Wall, and they're opening a can of worms with all these transgenders, and I'm not against them but, how would I put it, the gay people and all this stuff, those people have been around for hundreds of years, and everybody's worked around them, and I'm ok with them... but they don't force me to accept their beliefs, and that's what the Democratic party are trying to do, force people to accept them. If the democratic party would straighten up and be for the American people, I might go back to em and vote for em, but right now absolutely not. And not to mention em killing babies, I can't stand that /ae/ it would be, they forget that what they said in the past has been recorded on TV and videos, and turn around and say something else completely different, they need to stay one way or the other, quit this flip flopping, either you are or you ain't... you don't know what you are or you ain't /ae/ no 
353756	they are dishonest / ae / they are only interested staying in power and leading us to marxism / ae / no 
353983	handling of the Israel and Gaza conflict, abortion , balance budget, immigration is an issue, far left wing is ut of touch with the country, packing the court 
354122	It seems to be some people who do progressive activism that's a superiority thing like if someone who sees themself as more educated will talk down to certain groups of people and I experience that some at [REDACTED] University due to being from [REDACTED] by students from [REDACTED] and places with a better education system. I don't liuke neo-liberalism. /AE/ No.

354361	They don't allow the economy to thrive /AE/ They, um, trying to be respectful...the democratic party doesn't have the best interest of the people at heart or in mind /AE/ they want it to be a one world order, communist or socialism and by history we know that neither of those work /AE/ No

354599	the extremely liberal agenda and the republicans have gone to the extreme, no partisian 
354914	I guess I don't like that they let Joe Manchin, the senator from west virginia, hold up a lot of bills, and that they did not find some way of convincing him to join the rest of them. /AE/ No that's really about it. 
355224	hard to decide when it comes to the country hard to make decisions 
355272	The like to take from the working man too much and dig in thier pockets and give it to someone who swam accross the river who get rewarded just for making it here. /ae/ I don't believe from taking from somebody who has earned what they worked for just to give to someone else. Theres a reason they have what they have and it's called working for it. Thats whats great about this country is you can earn as much or as less as you want it's up too you. and tohse who generally have have worked for it. those who dont are the ones sitting on the bench at the park complaining and that's where the democrats come in./ae/ no 
355323	The are ruining the economy/ae/no 
355622	lack of organization. 
355699	foreign policy,economy, income tax 
355942	They've gotten lax on things./ae/no 
355971	What I dont like is that they try to please everybody and you cant. You have to think about what's best for the country as a whole so we can keep the country strong and free for the future generations. If you start trying to take care of every single person there's gonna nothing left. That includes the immigrants coming into this country. The old democrats are so different from the new democrats. The new democrats are much more liberal I'm a moderate but the world went left on me. I voted for [REDACTED] so. I'm economically conservative and socially liberal. That was the old time demrats and republicans. They just paint you as racist if you don't agree with what they believe, I'm far from that I just want to do what's right for the country. I never voted for Reagan because I felt he was too conservative, I just didn't vote. /AE/ It's more like I don't like the way they're taking over the media, but I feel that the democrat party is not open to hearing other points of view, close-minded. /AE/ And I don't like the green agenda and what they;ve done with the energy, oil and fracking and all of that. I think it all need to be done in amore careful manner, but we need a strong oil policy to have a strong country, independent of foreign oil, which is what we had under trump so we need him back. it's why our energy costs are nuts here in connecticut. /AE/ I could go on but that's enough. 
356134	lose focus on ancutal wining, they can get to bough by corporate interest. 
356222	Both sides have taken all the rights that the president has AE 
356722	The one thing I have against the democratic party is the money they spend. We keep getting further and further into debt every day/ae/no 
356884	economic policies. These seem to have lead to a very harsh economic enviroment for the average american citizen//ao// sometimes their progressive agenda can get in the way of more pratical politcal matters//ao//no 
356927	Some of the members are a lot more focused on their picture to where they say stuff that contradicts the policies that they have put in place. Certain issues are easy for them to take to extremes sometimes with no basis. /AE/ NO 
357011	The lack of empathy toward folks that have a pro-life or anti-abortion stance. A/E No. 
357625	So, this an an uncertainty more than anything else, I am uncertain of the, I question if the support of the democratic party is coming, I wonder where white men fall into being represented equally by the democratic party. /AE/ No, and that's more of an uncertainty than a dislike, plus you're enjoying typing. 
357747	They're no longer the Democratic party of yesteryear. They use the word Democrat in name only. I believe the word they're using more and more is they're progressives. And in my opinion, progressive is another word for socialists and I believe the Democratic party is actually the socialist party. /AE/ They seem to want to consolidate power for their party elite as opposed to representing their constituents as a whole. /AE/ I believe the democrats are using an ancient form of government that ancient Rome had called in english Bread and Circuses as a form of managing the masses. That's the way the Roman government kept the crowd sudated to keep them from realizing what's really going on and it's very important for people to take notice of. /AE/ I'm a student of history and the socialist democrats today are similar to NSDAP during the time of National Socialist Democratic Party. I say that because the one thing the so called Democrats are against is free speech and they do control the media. /AE/ 
357891	They are very willing to vote based on ideals rather than practical implications. 
357911	border policy / ae /taxes are higher / ae / cost of living is higher / general economi / ae/ no 
358037	Their views on money, or how to spread it /ae/ no 
358067	in general, many of them of are out of their minds and choose feelings and identity politics and globalism over facts and a solid need for healthy nationalism/ae/no 
358094	I just don't like some of their stances. They are a little too far out on some of their stances like abortion, LGBTQ. 
358578	The way exploit people/ae/no 
358730	I think there is a lot of division in the Democratic party and we could use a lot of that Republican master-mind and strategy; we have gotten more left with figures like Bernie Sanders, and the squad and pushing the party in that direction; it still really bothers me that the democratic party takes large sums of money from billionaires, even if they are on the right side of the story; I'd like to think they are the party of the people but it is hard to hear when a candidate you like and respect takes a large donation from a large corporation; I definitely think campaign finance reform is something we should try to fix in the party; i think the democratics are still struggling with talking to that portion of middle america that might not have a college education and relate to the every person; they are still considered the coastal elite party; /AO/ No. 
358765	Their views on the nuclear family. Their views on transgenderism. Their policy prescriptions on immigration. I believe they are nicer to immigrants and they don't have as much resentment towards them. But their almost open border policies..I believe they are going about it in the wrong ways, with there almost open if not open border policies. /AO/ Umm, their views on systemic racism and race in general I do not agree with. Their views on policing in America, specifically defund the police, I don't agree with. Their views on foreign policy. I believe they should be more of an isolationist. Yes, their view on the economy umm, I do support some of them but I think a lot of their view, I lean more right on the economy. And then, regarding their stance on transgenderism specifically, I do not agree with that. For a long time the Democratic Party was for the civil rights of all people including gay and lesbians and I support those rights. However, I think from my point of view, the transgendered ideology is illogical and takes away from the ability to progress the rights of people who are not straight. And I think that the democratic party focuses too much on promoting the rights of trans people and I think they should step back from that and attack the issue from a clinical or psycological standpoint because it seems to me that having been in high school when the transgender thing blew up again that people were simply stating that they were a part of that to fit in or to progect their problems into and I believe that transgenderism is simply a social contagion because the is research that shows that. And also, in the seventies there were transexuals which are different from the transgenders in their ideologies and the transgender ideology seems to be illogical and I thing that the democratic party should focus on the real issues including the violence and discrimination against people who are gay and lesbian. Because those people are, because there is no reason or currently no explanation about why those people are gay or lesbian. And, I think that the transgender movement is taking the spotlight from gay rights which is what the democratic party fought for for a long time. And simply just think that the transgenderism stuff is illogica and can be solved with psychiatric interventions. /AO/ NO 
358767	th elack of working across party lines but again that faces both parties/ao/trying to stand behind what they know what needs to be done and standing behind it/ao/no 
358780	too extremely left /ao/ 
358797	The use of supporting marginalized groups to cover up news of policies that may be just as detrimental as policies imposed by the republican party /ae/ 
359131	Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pelosi, 
359188	I don't like the way they have handled immigration. /AO/ The way they stopped building the wall, the wall that would have stopped all this immigration that is coming in. Donald Trump had everything in place, they could have finished it. Biden stopped it. And the cross country pipeline. I do not like how they stopped the cross country pipeline. /AO/ NO 
359299	To much money. 
359322	Sometimes they fight dirty. Always try to be so proper and correct that they lose their timing 
359345	they messaging they make promeses that they did not come through with it. 
359361	I don't like that they don't do anything about affordable housing that's a real problem /AE/ no 
359614	the way they handled the last four years 
359646	i do not like thei stance on abourtion; their liberal stance on sexual stuff in schoolds; their spending, and taxes that their raise; I dont like their social agenda; I dont think that as a part they are string in the the world 
359760	It's tough wording these things, on the screen when it's verbatim. I understand world peace is important, helping everyone, but I think their focus is too much on that, not home first. /AE/ Too many detailed issues they're concerned about when the big picture needs to fixed first. /AE/ No. 
359773	delusional , extream liberalism emotional orient//ao//no 
359839	I have been concerned abut the deemocratic party's positin in regards to palestine and israel /AE/ yes in addition i'm concerned about the democratic party (both parties) still supporting the military industrial complex. /AE/ Yes I'm also concerned about the democratic party's policy in regards to Iran /AE/ Not that I can think of right now 
359848	feel like they dont have enough of a say and are being controlled by other forces ae thats good 
359882	I just don't like them. A/E They haven't done a good job, they run everything into the ground. Everything has gotten worse. A/E That sums it up. 
360129	I do worry about being too soft on international relations and while I don't know how to resolve issues like immigration, houselessness, and addiciton, it feels like we're going in the wrong direction on those issues/ae/no 
360194	Naive toward dirty tricks by the opposition./AE/ 
360536	How they're handling all this with the foreign stuff and the immigration, or, the immigrants that's coming across the border /ae/ and how they just don't take care of Americans /ae/ no 
360636	too liberal with benefits for people / ae/ to not and send to themselves / ae / they like to save everybody but people need to find the way to survy on their own / ae / extrem views on regulations / ae / forcing people to take singular path such as green energy as suppose to checking its balance between green energy and fule use and the hase of each use / ae / sometimes they focus on insurance people feeling good such as children in school with no facing nor sercuty as a result of school campus as a target for people with mental health issues and wapons / ae / schools should be sercuer as air port to protect our students and faculty / ae / no 
360982	there is nopt enough being said hiw they afre goinf to do things/ao/no 
361115	Too much goverment too much spending does not support the constitution the govern the top 20 cities in the country and they are all crime ritten they are soft on crime forcing trans agenda on school kids thats huge now thats enough/ ae/ no 
361702	they have gone too far left, they havent done anything about immigration 
361718	maybe they want to spend a little too much money, we had a large tax influx but didn't materialize, nice things promised. 
361853	in think they need a little more bACK BONE IMDISSAPOINTED IN JPES BIDENS /AO/NO 
361932	they havent been standing up against the republicans enough. they are getting better. 
362090	that they try to get everybody and everything run by the government, doesn't like that, healthcare with obamacare, they raise taxes /AE/ No 
362168	I don't like their policies AE 
362218	I also think the democrate party is vunerable to the large donor and they are rich themselves so it makes it hard for them to represent a broader scale of people. and for both parties we have a lot of older people in carge and I don't like that./AO/No 
362604	I dont like that what they say are their ideals is not what they do in prctice; specifically I am not in favor of their abortion olicy; and their economic practices ; isn't necessarilty that they practice what they preach 
362661	I don't like that it s liberal for the sake of being liberal ONLY. and it's liberal just it seems to spite conservatism not because its right, but because its contrary to conservatism. It's created a bunch of entitled pussies. 
362679	They are not tough enough 
362782	I feel like they stole the election, there was some tampering that went /AE/ Yeah um they're all out for themselves the last 4 governors of illinois are in prison /AE/ Well I don't like the defund the police thing, and how they will um politicize the DOJ and the FBI um you know they set up the DOJ like they're out to get trump theyre trying anything in their power to get him out I feel the democrats had something to do with him getting shot in the ear /AE/ They don't want to prosecute murderers or anything like big crime stuff how they're letting everybody through the border but they're not vetting anyone so we don't now if they're murderers or rapists and that's all coming to a head with all these new murders and rapes /AE/ Everything /AE/ Like I said about how they stole the 2020 election /AE/ Again that's enough let's just go on 
362831	They cant be honest about anything. They use race as a way to get people to vote for them always have and always will. it about race and poor People 
362901	the crime rate, economy, illigals, handle foreing affars. 
362971	Their stance on abortion 
362976	Probably a little more liberal abortion stance than I would choose, actually a lot more /ae/ No 
362981	i feel like they can be pushovers sometimes they lack a backbone at some point i feel like they attempt too much to include everybody in every decision they get parallyzed to the point they cant make a decision 
363127	Our economy seems to decrease in the times that Democratic leadership are in the White House. For instance I've noticed that gas prices are higher when Democrats are in the White House. Oh and were currently seeing higher inflation that is really effecting our economy specifically working class Americans. /AO/ no 
363438	seomtimes more right leaning than I would like, not regulating corporations/ae/ no

364684	The democratic party is highly ineffective at both getting their messae acroos to people are getting things done when they are in power. 
365110	I don't like their immigration. I don't like their, pro LGBTQ, I don't want to say LGBTQ, but specifically like the transgender part of it and I'll say specifically the education in the schools about it. /AO/ The economy, inflation the cost if living going up. Especially in this area. /AO/ No 
365449	Too liberal, pro choice, too many handouts, too much given to illegal immigrants, innacurate spending I would say, I don't approve of the way they spend their money on what, crime, I feel they're fairly weak on crime, defund the police /AE/ No 
365496	Feel they could be fighting class conditions better and social equity better, they can put more actions and their words and be more agre fighting against miss information. 
365558	I don't like the way they hold their primaries, I don't like the way the leader of the democrats handle third party candidates ike Bernie Sanders, they are dismissive and I don't like that, Debbie Wasserman Schultz /ae/ no, that's all 
365669	i dont like the idea of everything being like a socialist kind of thing/ao/no 
365679	The main one is abortion that is probably the biggest thing for me. Like I said I am not against gay people but I am not pro it either. I physically suppose disagree with them on several points. I dont think we need to send money overseas unless we are paying debt or good and services and things like that. /ae/no 
365722	their stance on the budget 
365805	I think they really hate republicans, I think they want everyone to be a democrat, that might sound silly. I think they're more for themselves, not for everybody. I'm not saying all the democrats, just some of them. /AE/ No.

366836	I don't think they dumb things down well for not the majority but a lot of americans I think sometimes they act better than a lot of people which doesn't help and sometimes they're too liberal so there's that whereas they can't... it's going to be the same thing as the republican side where neither side wants to make concessions and so I think that's a big problem, that out of both the parties the democrats I feel like are going to have to be the ones that are going to have to make concessions, they fignt too hard for strong liberal values /AE/ they don't explain I feel what they really mean when they are taking about whatever issue they are talking about so that the people they need to turn to the other side, I live in southwestern missouri which is extremely red it's not that any one is stupid but you need to lay it out as to why, if you're talking about money and you say tax the rich you're talking about the 1% you're talking about .01% and if you're not talking about the .01 percent you do want to increase the entire 1%'s taxes then that needs to be clear, there's no clarity I don't like that there isn't any clarity.

373259	neither the Ds and Rs have done anything serious about Congressional corruption and getting rich by trading stocks that their committees give them inside knowledge.

I dislike that they seem to laugh at the idea of a middle class. That their policies do not protect a middle class but break it down. I dislike that they are sympathetic to socialist policies. That they view individualism as an obstacle to their agenda is frightening. /AE/ I find the idea that the state or government knows better for your children, I find that abhorrant. So the idea that parents don't have rights in education that they are laughed at, scoffed at and pushed aside is something that I attribute to the democratic party and something that I hate about the democratic party. /AE/ I find the constant narrative that we should be ashamed of this country distasteful, especially in the context that the only time we are allowed to be proud of this country is when the democrats have their way. /AE/ No

376652	Complete lack of confidence right now, corruption, making money, violating govt ethics, party split, creating confusion, shifting to the left /ae/ no

Example is the ine people hoax basically they edited a comment when Trump was in office claiming that he was for neo-nazis and other distasteful people. If you listen to the whole speech, he cuts out all the neo-nazis and says that this comment dd not apply to them. The comment that there are fine people on both side of this issue/ae/no.

379572	The one thing that I know for sure that I don't like is that it seems like whenever they don't get their way on an issue, they try and change the rules to make it so they win regardless. Whereas I feel like Republicans play within the rules. /AE/ I don't really like how things have turned into a witch hunt this past, I don't know it seems like it's been going on onger than 4 years now, and a lot to it seems to stemp from the democratic party, and that's probably aobut it,

382412	a little heavy on the idiological side; theres so many issues to go back and forth, and by being idiological there a certain point of which side of the fence you're on, which gets them into trouble; Kamala likes to be practical, and if your idiological it gets you in a bind; for instance the REP argument on the deep state in about authrotarianism, and theres validity; I suffer from seeing idiological ..so I say the DEM are more idiological than they need to be; they are ephemeral

388961	The racial divide that's causing in the country the fact that presidential candidates can speak to the african american populace if you don't vote for me you are not black should never come out of a white person's mouth and the fact that sexism and racism is brought up so common that it's not meant to unite but to keep people divided to incite division perpetually /AE/ Their entire tax plan and the fact that we're going towards more of a socialist setting economically that if our economy continues we will hit another great depression /AE/ That's good 
388982	I think they cheat, lie steal, to win. /AE/ Yeah I don't think they have the american people first in their decision making, I think they're power hungry and corrupt. /AE/ I think that covers it. 
388996	their sometimes they are alittle too generous our citizrens dont have to work theor are too many freebees amnd getting people to work is very hard people dont haver to or want to work and need to get education/ao/no 
389028	the forcing of the LGBTQ ordeal, the um, just corrupt man, it's just corrupt /AE/ the way that they funnel their money, what they choose to funnel the money into /AE/ their stance on gun control, their stance on illegal immigrants, allowing public housing and benefits to people who are not native to this country /AE/ all them folks slewing across the border coming to NY on buses all them folks their allowing to come here saying if yo vote Democrat we'll give you housing and benefits, a lot of stuff, that ideological pushing of things being taken out of the schools, like the pledge of allegiance, a lot schools use to pray in the mornings, they don't do that anymore /AE/ the no child left behind bullshit act /AE/ all of it man /AE/ not off the top of my head I'm sure if you give me some time I can think of other things /AE/ no ma'am 
389211	everything//ao/ I can't think of one good thing//ao//no 
389232	feel like the democratic dont thing much about the American anymore / ae / no 
389434	A couple of individual members on the local level /AE/ No 
389494	 I don't like theri stand on abortion, their stand on illegal immigrants, on foreign relations, on the economy/ae/no 
389549	liberlism/ao/no 
389715	Everything. /AE/No I don't think so. 
389759	I don't feel like they've done as much for working Americans as they could, i feel they're unable, they're not as progressive as they should be, I don't even think the progressives are as progressive as they should be /ae/ no 
389789	i feel theyre trying to control everything in our life, and governmental society where the government rules everything 
389829	Too many handouts /AE/ No 
389969	Their policy on immigration and taxes and crime. 
389971	They could compromise more. /AE/ Nope. 
390206	Personally i'm more conservative in my views and I find the democratic party to be too liberal. It goes too far in my view. 
390244	Everything about Donald Trump 
390407	Their stand on abortion, their stand on immigration, and their stand on the second amendment and the supreme court, and the what is it that decides the presidency, the final one. That they want do away with. I forget the name, but I don't agree with them. I mean A because years ago they were fairly trustworthy. /AE/ There's probably a lot but, I'm jut so disappointed with them. /AE/ I don't like how they're trying to buy votes with, here's $25,000 fo your mortgage. I'm going to zero out your college loans, which means that everybody else who pays taxes is not paying your college loans. And a lot of people, the only reason I got an associate's degree is because that's all I could afford to pay for. And some people didn't go to college because they couldn't afford it! It's not right to settle the bills for college on the people who are stuck paying for it, which are the people who didn't go to college because they couldn't afford it and they didn't want to go into debt. The electoral college, they're trying to do away with that, that bothers me. /AE/ I think that's probably enough for now. 
390479	I think sometimes the democratic party struggles to work as a team. There can be divided factions. I think that right now there's a lof of unity, which is heartening. I think sometimes also the Democratic party allows right-wing people to frame issues and follows along with their framing of things when I think it's important to not fall into those kinds of traps. That's about it. /ae/ no. 
390533	no comment /AE/ that's all 
390574	they try to be for everyone ae/ in the end they hurt most ae/ thats it 
390645	Their economy plans, their immigration laws, the way they handle foreign activities /AE/ I don't like their abrtion laws and I understand women's rights but they're taking it too far and I don't believe in that sex change bull sh** either, I don't agree with tax payers paying for it, if they want a sex change they can pay for it on their own /AE/ That's pretty much it 
391287	Socialism part of their beliefs/ae/too free with my money/ae/no 
391578	they tend to get focused on some extreme things, and not let the Republucans get a hold of; the more they focus on the UNITY, and not every single group ; they tend to get a little to broad in seeking out differences; international they seem to be pretty with it now; I thing they tried to deal with the border, but i think this would be one of the areas we need to come toegther on 
391904	They are not paying attention/ae/no 
391919	The appointed leadership for candidates, I think they could find someone better. /AE/ No. 
391970	Como manejan los problemas que tienen otros paises entre si.Meten su cuchara se meten mucho en donde no les importa. No debe importarles Segun yo. Por ejemplo un pais comete asesinatos y lo apoyan Israel pero igual que los igual que hamas y gaza franja de gaza igual que el tienden a cometer asesinatos pero el pais los democtratas los apoyan ciegamente los apoyyan incondicionalmente a israel . Son unos asesinos. /ao/ Ahora no se si los democtatas y republican quieren invadir a mexico militarmente. lo cual considero un error acepto la forma como lo estan asiendo como se estan metiendo a mexico. la daa y tambien la caa y sobretoda la dea y fbi unos se estan metiendo a mexico . Si acepto como se estan metiend a mexico para ayudar a mexico con la ayuda del fbi y la dea se han realizado buenas cosas muy buenas aprensiones de narcos de criminales. /ao/ ha intervenido mucho el fbi con mexico para aprender a narcotraficantes de bastante malos. Que desean intervenir militarmente dentro de mexico /ao/ no es la manera de solucionar las cosas lo que hacen de manera inteligente si lo veo perfectamente bien. /ao/ Meterse intervenir dentro de mexico militarmente. /ao/ Y que deporten no me gusta que deporten directamente a mexico y no se hacen deportaciones a sus respectivos paises . Que se hagan deportaciones a sus respectivos paises no a mexico. Mexico tiene el problema que el gobierno de Estados unicos deporta a la gente para alla Y no a sus respectivos paises. /ao/ Eso es todo 
391981	Their approach on some immigration laws and that's probably about it. All I can think of off the top of my head. And gun control laws. /AE/ No. 
392069	The Democratic Party is actually more conservative than I would like it to be. I believe they do that to appeal to people that have more middle of the road views, are more conservative, but that limits their ability to do progressive things that I would hope the democratic party would accomplish when they're in office. /ao/ although I always voted democratic for the presidential elections, I have found that most of the time, we are still engaged in foreign conflicts that it are not always successful when they try to put progressive policies in place, economic, environmental policies - despite their best efforts it doesn't always work out the way I hope it will when there's a democratic person in office. /ao/ no. 
392078	they are kind of hypCRYTICAL/AO/NO 
392210	how they've allowed our country to be fall into shambles in the last four year, cost of living, cost of housing, interest rates, gas prices, not giving military raises /ao/ no 
392354	the extrreme side of the party/TM/ seems to be an agenda of the very liberal side that is outside the main stream/ae/ no 
392373	They seem to be anti-constutition, anti-law enforcement, anti-border, and they are extremely dishonest in how they are handling almost everything in govt right now. A/E No 
392584	I don't agree with their overall view on abortion, i don't agree with the decisions that were made with the economy and the decisions that were made with safety and security nation 
392811	Everything that I said that I liked about the Republican party in reverse. You know, and there again there's been a lot of really good democratic presidents but, ever since Jimmy Carter it got off the rails somewhere. /AO/ No 
392941	Dishonest/ae/I feel they are not about us. They are more about having power and having control and having more government which I disgree with/ae/no 
393194	I think, basicall the hand outs; I dont like the idea of we're going to help every Us citizen by making it way for every one without having to work for their right to be here; i think we're the US because we have the American dream, and everyone here has what they need for make something of them selfves, and the democrates make it easy, and I think it perpatuated alot of evil in our worlds, and I dont think we should be supportuing evr ideas anyone has just under the idea of trying to be inclusive; govertent spending 
393245	When they adhere to strict party lines for the sake of adhering/they dont agree with other political party/ae/no 
393357	they continue to divide the nation AE its the special interests and all the divisions everything kind of stems from that AE no 
393531	Their commitment to Israel, I can see and evebody can see that Israel is killing those Palestinians and they doing in on purpose, an agreement or Ally is not an excuse to send them weapon to do that. 
393753	I don't like the way they try to get you to vote on emotions/ae/taxes seem to go up more/ae/how they spend money/ae/both parties run each other down all the time/ae/no. 
393794	i deont like nothing they do/ao/no 
393820	Politician, they play politics. 
393905	not united 
393932	Progect 2025 and the parties unwillingness to stand up to Donald Trump /AE/ no Oh, I heard Republican party when you said that. Lets move that whole answer to the Republican party. About that I don't like that they have seemed a little directionless and soft spoken for lack of a better term. /AE/ NO 
394739	They think with one mind. Whatever their extreme position is, there is no discussion. And they want to be involved with every aspect of your life. I think there are two individually motivated for their own wealth as opposed to the good of the country. 
395139	Higher ups like Biden, Harris and Schumer are to far left wing liberal. 
395173	i fee t like they are a few that are too centrist and right fewwing and they dont want to make change but stoick with the status quote/ao/no 
395598	their anger, wierd tactics, and ilogical argument,AO/no 
395658	They don't promote all the accomplishments that they have done; it should be more in the news, what they've done. /AO/ no. /AO/ like the infrastructure things they have done; and health. /AO/ no. 
395901	I think there are facade seekers on both parties, including the Democrats /ao/ no 
395904	I think that there is a stagnancy to the structure and a higherarchy that's not effective in creating change and representative to how I feel /AE/ I don't like that the median age doesn't feel representative of me or considerate of future issues particularly action on climate change doesn't seem to be actively addressed the way I'd like it to be. /AE/ No 
395998	they are following the dictatorship that is running the govt. now/ae/ thats bad enough 
396012	The way they run the united states/ao/they doing their jobs. they are letting immigration getting run over. /ao/ 
396227	I feel they don't manage money as well as the Republican party/ae/I think sometimes we spend too much money in general and I don't think helping people of lower economic status has to be one or the other. I think you can help poor people without mismanaging the money./ae/no 
396256	I don't like a lot of their plicies and stances. I don't like their open boarders. I don't like their abortion late term abortion.; I donot like their taking and decrminializing a variety of felonies. I don't like their support of violience during riots and I don't liek the boardlines socialist communicist approach to things/AE/ I don't liek their tendancy to bad mouyth and put down citizen that have a differnt position then theirs. Calling us garbage and deplorable and sutff. I don't like the number of Sutioant where democatres clearly committed crimes and one one took them to task or charged them /ae/no 
396258	sometimes go way too far left for me ae/ thats it 
396470	the amount of donations they receive from corporate sponsore make it seem like they are advocating for corps. instead of constituents. /ae/ no 
396692	they believe all americans should be dependent on the gov. for everything.

397025	there more like temammates its an overall not individual and they kind of get pissy if you dont agree with them/ao/no 
397079	Same thing as I said politicians in general I dont trust any of them. I think they are just out for themselves and they don't care about the country. /ae/that's it I cant think of anything. 
397466	don't like their policies /ao/ not honest, they cheat a lot /ao/ about it. 
397505	They don't work for the working man, and the policies they pass are really to buy votes. They'll stand for any marginal party, but the working man is not in their... We don't get the support from the democratic party, the marginalized parties do, if you're an immigrant, a minority, the Q, whatever the alphabet is, for those groups they'll pass laws to support those groups. But for the working man I don't see anything being done, it's just tax those guys some more. /AE/ That really, in my life that covers it. 
398214	their leftist movement/ao 
398518	cant seem to get out of their own way, can be a little wishy washy, and spend to much time analizing thing instead of getting things done. 
398598	I know that there... it's very touchy when it comes to them saying they will do something and not do it or the example is that they tell us the american people to do this and they don't do it themselves. /ae/ No that's it. 
398837	a little bit too liberal and unbalanced, i do not agree with abortion 
399113	they are readical and ungodly and I just cannot think of anything good/oa/ no 
399387	The current state of our economy/AO/No
