V240001	V241110 - PRE: What is it that R likes about Democratic Presidential candidate [text]
140003	She is a woman who advocates for reproductive rights and will defend our democracy from the far right.
140006	She is a proven leader who cares about this country and democracy
140012	She seems to be a good person with decent morals and values
140014	She is the best candidate on the ballot.
140017	Strong record as a prosecutor in California, especially in regards to crime and consumer protection.
140018	logical, work with both parties, try to find solutions to real problems
140019	Ms. Harris supports abortion rights. Should a Supreme Court opening occur, she would nominate a more open minded justice to the bench. She would do what is best for the country versus what is best for her herself. She nominated someone who is a much better vice presidential choice than the other candidate. I liked that she was an attorney general versus a billionaire. She has a better position on gun control then the other candidate.
140023	She is not over 80 years old, and she seems to want to continue the tradition of voting, unlike her electoral opponent.
140026	She sticks to facts and is in favor of programs for working people
140029	Not Trump, Not Biden
140030	not to take away women's rights
140033	she's smart, driven, articulate, understands social issues, advocates for women's right to choose, cares for the environment and recognizes HUMAN caused climate change, advocates for low and middle class workers, recognizes the many inequalities in the US, pragmatic about the war in Gaza, she understands US history,
140035	I like that her group of advisors are younger
140037	SK
140038	Knowledgable and experienced for the position, major policy goals align with mine (gun control, foreign policy, abortion), I like that she is a woman and a POC
140039	her genuine desire to do good for her country - also her broad experience in government and her sense of morality
140048	moderate, intelligent, reasonable
140050	She's a well-accomplished attorney who has held major positions (attorney general in California); is black ethnically; and from her past accomplishments is well suited to be the President of the United States.[CHAR(10)]
140052	I believe that she will preserve our democratic norms and that she will put the best interests of the country before her own interests.
140055	she is calm and collected, she does not appear to ‘makeup’ stories. She and President Biden are behind the union’s. The unions are for middle class people, for just wages and health benefits, etc [CHAR(10)].
140056	she's not Donald Trump. tries to make the world a better place
140057	don't care for trump
140060	I don’t watch too much about the issues but Harris is for eliminating student debt and she’s a woman of color and I’m ready for a change in thought hopefully in politics. might make me actually pay attention more
140061	she worked alongside President carrying out his agenda, she has had expérience at different levels of government, she is a woman
140062	She is a candidate of a major party who sees the people’s struggles (i.e., crippling student loan debt) and wants to help them. Also, because she is not Donald Trump, who is an enormous liar, crook, and horrible person. I should add that I believe that at this point, only a candidate from one of the 2 major parties has a chance of becoming president. The other parties just do not have enough voters. Therefore I must choose Harris in order to make sure Trump does not become president, even if I would consider other candidates.
140063	Salt Tax reenactment
140065	she’s not Trump for starters! she doesn’t sow division, she doesn’t spew hatred and racism and bigotry like trump does and she’s against project 2025.
140066	She is not Donald Trump. She is also acceptable to me as I am a Bernie Sanders social democrat.
140067	She wants to govern, not just win. I like her positive attitude. She cares about the environment.
140068	her policies regarding student loans forgiveness
140072	Ibeleiveshecanbetrustedwithournation[CHAR(10)]
140076	She has good background skills in government Attorney General Calif, Senator, Calif, and most important Vice President under Pres Biden for 3.5 years now. And also Donald Trump is a disaster for our country and ruined the old GOP which was not my party but certainly legitimate.

140141	protections for women’s reproductive rights and lgbtq rights
140142	Kamala Harris is for the American people. She was a prosecutor who put bad people away asks got them off the streets. She was also a district attorney. She has alot of knowledge and experience in politics. Something that Donald Trump doesn't even come close to having !
140144	She is serious about doing a good job for the country and understands the complexity of the world. She may not be my favorite politician, but I trust her to do her best and keep in mind what is important when she is making the big decisions.

140159	I prioritize social issues. As a Democrat from California, she essentially has no choice but to go left on most social issues.

140243	If Harris is elected POTUS, the GOP may finally figure out that continuing to vote for Trumpist candidates is a losing proposition. But ... it would probably need to be a clear blow-out victory for the GOP to break it's ensorcellment with Trumpism. I have my doubts.
140245	Yes she's competent smart has integrity and will fight to save are democracy from Trump Puten the fascist Republican party the fascist American oligarchs and the fascist white Christan" nationalists who supported trump's failed coup attempt to stay in power and bring down are democracy and are all out to try again.

140282	She sounds like she is ready to be President. So far she hasn't talked about Donald Trump or that I have heard. She has answered back when he has said something to her directly, but he only says crap while on the campaign tour. The debates should be interesting.

She is energetic and can promote hope and excitement. She works hard in the face of adversity and is a strong woman who sees a bigger picture than Trump. She’s not a pathological liar.

140641	SK
140643	[CHAR(10)]KAMALA Harris has much more interest in the People (truly) on domestic issues than Felonious-Trump (a liar and manipulator). She is personable, smart. However, she did not prosecute Mnuchin of Calif. who corrupted the housing situation back in approx. 2008-09. And she over-prosecuted Black offenders for small crimes that White offenders got away with or got lighter sentences for. I agree with her prosecuting/penalizing parents of truant-kids to an appropriate degree (depending on each situation). [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]HOWEVER, I'm waiting to see if Kamala Harris will change course re foreign policy/ISRAEL-GAZA/WestBank/Jerusalem. I've been involved in following (& being active for Peace) in this conflict since around 2006. I've grown to see the horrendous fraud on the American Public re the truth of what this conflict is about, yet the World generally sees the issues clearly, more accurately as they/we stand for Palestinian Liberation and a Two-State (or other viable) solution. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]The corporate/money-motivted USA Gov't/MilitaryIndustrialComplex(ity) refuses to see the obvious. I WILL NOT vote for Kamala Harris unless she comes out before the Election for a USA full-Arms Embargo against transferring weaponry to Israel for killing Palestinians. I've written to her saying that (& giving opinion re Israel/Palestine) via www.Whitehouse.gov/contact . [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Netanyahu is a mad-man not unlike Hitler. Hamas is not pristine, but they are more an Armed Resistance than a Terrorist. USA leaders along with the heartless/nasty/hateful Israeli leaders have something else in mind as they support this Genocide and thumb their noses at the ICJ and ICC. America and Israel are the Bigger Terrorists!! [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I'm sick and tired of USA's constant wars and manipulating other countries, installing" dictator leaders in other countries, killing civilians left and right in whatever they put their triggered fingers on! www.AddictedToWar.org America's Gov't are Imperial Corporate PowerMongers who are in essence WarMongers.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I am sickened by America's stupidity and lack of morality/ethcis/legality about Israel/Palestine - and involvement in a Genocide. TOTALLY DISGUSTING!! It harrasses, hurts, disturbs, and makes many of WeThePeople anxious and upset in our daily living. Some friends (and I, as well) don't sleep as well, as we feel compassion for the Palestinians enduring this 21st Century Holocaust in the name of "defense", supported by Terrorist America. Absolutely ABSURD! [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Sen. Bernie Sanders is the main USA leader who had it right when, months ago, he called for the USA to withhold all weaponry and funding for Israel in order to lead to a CEASEFIRE, RETURN of Hostages, AID for GAZANS et al., and a PEACE Solution (e.g., Two-State). [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]NO, I won't vote for Harris if she does not come out soon for withholding weaponry & funding for Israel's horrific GENOCIDE. This issue is so extreme and important beyond the good things she might try to implement--like removing abortion bans, free college, paid leave, better healthcare (or Single Payer even), better pay, gun control, etc.--most of which have to go through Congress anyway. And most of Congress, esp. Republicans, are against these things and won't vote for them. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]We have a corrupted Congress and Election system too. Citizens United and NOT using RANKED CHOICE VOTING taints our system. And the TwoBiggieParties (Dems&Repubs) suppress the Third Parties to an UNdemocratic Degree---won't let them debate with them, try to disqualify ballot access, and the mainstream corporate media goes along with this--ignoring main Third Party candidates who are, it appears to me, more honest, more caring, more accurate, more ethical, more intelligent than the BigTwo Prez Candidate who obey their corporate masters in order to "get ahead"! It's a sham.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I'm very interested in EU election systems: much more intelligent, most parties have equal footing, and there isn't all this money thrown around. Scandinavia seems to be very democratic. I'm hoping to visit Sweden to learn more about their more Social Democracy way of life--more my style, more equitable, compassionate, efficient--leading to less crime and homelessness. Scandinavian countries are, by in-depth studies, happier countries because of the way their countries are run and how their elections are MORE DEMOCRATIC than the BigTwoParty near-dictatorship here--that suppresses other parties...with MONEY being a BigFactor. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Amen! Thanks for reading :) [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]"

142130	she is more responsible and stand up for what people need not spitting stupid messages
142132	FREEDOM, AND ECONOMIC
142133	She has done nothing in the last 3+ years that is beneficial to this country. She is a known liar and says what the people want to hear (for votes) but has no intention on following through, or she would have already done something about the things she would" do. She has no known experience to run this country. She won't debate Donal Trump because she knows all of this is true and he will challenge her. "
142134	Opposite of what D Trump stands for
142137	ensure the maintenance of democracy
142138	First, she's not Donald Trump. Often I vote the lesser of two evils, rather than for a particular candidate. Last time I did that it was for Obama, not against McCain. Second, even with a good Republican candidate, she seems to be clear, level headed and focused as much as anyone can be on the role of president.
142139	I love her! She is competent and coherent and will not strip civil rights away from anyone who doesn't agree with her.
142141	She treats humans with dignity.
142144	She's not Donald Trump. She'll be the first woman in the White House as POTUS. She is a woman of color for a middle class family & knows what it means to struggle. I believe she will try her best to help better the lives of the people of where she came from.
142146	Kamala is for women's rights. Kamala is not a criminal.
142148	She cares about everyone
142155	Her platform of continuing what Pres. Biden & she started. Growing the economy from the bottom up & middle out.[CHAR(10)]Backs labor (Unions).[CHAR(10)]Wants to improve education.[CHAR(10)]Climate change.
142162	I believe she is more appropriate for this position than Donald Trump.
142163	she’s truthful, believes in the true idea of America . Believes in women rights and equality for all.
142164	She's for the people and has said exactly what she plans to do She stands for the rights of all people. Is decent and respectable.
142165	agree with healthcare expansion
142169	She's not perfect but generally a fairly progressive democratic politician. She seems to be committed to being economically progressive (she's talking about taking on big banks, supporting social security, etc.) as well as doing a good job of attacking republicans on the social issues that they're weak on (abortion). I also really like her VP candidate Tim Walz. I think Kamala picking Walz is really savvy because I feel like in many past elections they would've picked Shapiro or Buttigieg or another person that the Democratic Party leaders liked but Democratic voters don't care for. One thing about many democrats is their policy is clearly better than republicans but they don't actually accomplish it. By her picking Walz (a man who was able to accomplish his policy despite a narrow grip on the legislature) I think she showed a lot of competence herself and commitment to actually doing things if possible.
142172	Women's Rights. More honest.
142176	She is an educated woman of color, who has worked hard to build & establish a career & a good reputation. She has shown that she knows how to respectful inspite of being called names & being insulted.[CHAR(10)]
142190	Strong Democrat
142191	Her stance on women's rights.
142193	has knowledge about the job and will not create problems like Trump does.
142194	not the other party candidate
142195	I think that she has baggage from her previous work in California. She is in favor of non-therapeutic abortion. I think that I would have preferred Kelly or Shapiro as running mates, but none of these, or any other, drawbacks will prevent me from voting FOR her. If Biden had remained as the candidate I should have voted Democratic, but that would have been more of a vote against Trump than for Biden. I think that the Democrats should have been preparing younger, vigorous candidates for several years now, certainly after 1/20/21. BOTH parties need new, competent blood -- and a lot of it. McConnell, for instance, is a prime example of excellence in the undertaker's art, and he has been so for years and years.
142202	Womens Rights, I believe we should have the choice for abortion. Some women very unwillingly become pregnant.
142206	she does have respect for humanity 👏
142207	her intelligence
142214	She wants to bring our country together and get rid of the hate.
142219	Kamala Harris has strong, positive views on the right of a woman to decide what to do with her body, medically. Additionally, she has solid ideas to boost the economy, such as tax cuts for the working class, including a major expansion of Medicare.
142220	She's been visible to me since she came into the Senate. I was impressed with how she questioned witnesses during impeachment trial, and how she questioned the Supreme Court wannabees during confirmation hearings.
142226	just afraid that Trump has gone over the edge.
142228	Her steadiness, willingness to listen to all viewpoints, her desire to protect a everyone’s right to choose and to protect all people.
142229	her authenticity
142231	Strong policies, knows whats she talking about & will help the economy stay strong
142232	support for democracy
142233	She is not as divisive and corrupt as Donald Trump.
142240	She is very positive and thoughtful, has well thought out answers when she talks. She seems genuine and like she has a plan in how to make things better for everyone.
142246	su procedencia, su experiencia, su honestidad y su total independencia y fidelidad sin ninguna duda a la Constitución de Estados Unidos.
142248	She has experience in the White House, an outspoken advocate for women and children. She will abide by the Constitution and she doesn’t behave like a spoiled five-year-old when speaking about other candidates.
142249	her views on abortion rights.Affirmative action,Education, and immigration
142251	i think she may be a bit more open minded and not so much old stuff man in the corner is always right because he a man.
142258	She has served as a senator and vice president which gives me the insight that she is knowledgeable in foreign policy and politics.
142259	I believe Kamala is a competent and fair politician. Her legal background as a prosecutor appeals to me - she is familiar with the system and the rules, and I believe will help restore normal order to our government (or, continue what Biden has already started). Her relatively youthful perspective (comparatively) also means, hopefully, that there will be slightly less rent seeking in politics than the last generation has for so long conducted.
142260	she is a markist
142261	women’s right to choose - abortion access
142262	Saving democracy, hopefully enacting changes to the supreme court, focus on education
142267	she is younger. I like her enthusiasm and her policies.
142269	complete opposite to DJT
142270	Harris has been a strong advocate for policies that support working families with children. She envisions a future where everyone has the chance to start a business, own a home, and build wealth for future generations a future that includes affordable health care, affordable child care, and paid leave.
142271	I like her policies especially her stance on womens rights and social security as well as her family values.
142278	She has no idea what she’s doing. Other countries will not respect her because she’s not respectable. And she’s an idiot.
142279	She has a brain and knows how to use it.
142283	I would like to know more about what she has done, but what I do know indicates she looks at the big picture and makes decisions for the best outcome- not just what she wants. She speaks as a person of honor, her work pre-VP was solid and supported public health and community needs. This is the type of leader we need. I believe she will continue to her ability, the work of Biden to maintain economy and reduce inflation. Her stance on gun safety is important and women's reproductive rights. much more, but these are important.
142284	she has the leadership skills and clear vision for taking America forward and protecting our rights and democracy
142285	she more honest than Trump
142294	she is a Democrat
142295	defending womens body autonomy
142296	I believe she has done a good job as VP so far in the US and overseas. I agree with many of her political positions.
142299	She is not Trump
142301	To be able to appoint Supreme Court justices.
142303	I agree with the Democratic parties platform and policies, especially with women's right to choose, social safety nets, and common sense gun legislation.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]While I can honestly say that Harris did not excite me before President Biden dropped out of the race, the more I learn about her, the more hopeful I become. She's a well educated politician that has plenty of experience in the courtroom, and I think that will help with come upcoming battles with Supreme Court oversight. In addition, I know she'll have an incredible cabinet and VP to support her candicay.
142304	I believe she wants better
142308	she's not a bully person. she is trying to keep the people of all colors in check with with the countries.[CHAR(10)]
142311	She’s young and grew up going to regular schools. She has a better idea of what it is like to be a regular person and what that means.
142315	She won't ban abortion, womens choice of their own
142316	she's not Donald Trump

142329	Her experience, I agree with her on some of her views.
142332	She is a well educated respectful woman who has a track record of great progressive action. I admire her!
142334	She demonstrates intelligence; has a legal background; and does not appear to shot from the hip". She is very experienced with government on state and federal levels and is in touch with people from all walks of life. Vice-president Harris also has demonstrated that she remains poised under pressure."
142339	Kamala plans to restore women’s reproductive rights, reform the Supreme Court, and work to correct climate change. She offers humanity, kindness, logical sound thinking and equality.
142340	-while I support many democratic views, I sometimes feel that the solutions are short sided (ie. give $ to cause but not solve the underlying problem)
142341	Yes she interested in helping the middle class and seniors. She a person that cares for people and wants help them. She very educated in the issues we have. She is very a good person that wants to help people that are down in life and wants to help people out
142349	She is not Donald Trump.
142352	She's more presidential, sensible, and intelligent.
142354	Her commitment to preserving our democracy.
142358	Willingness to invest in improving infrastructure; more likely to maintain or strengthen environmental protections; more likely to do something meaningful to help with the housing shortage and affordability crisis in major cities; more likely to continue the Biden administration's anti-trust stance and crack down on monopolization and corporate concentration of power. I'm not very confident she would actually do any of these things, and I think there is a high chance she will sell out to the highest bidder, but she's somewhat more likely to do more good than Trump. Of course, she's a heck of a lot less likely to do categorically bad things, like attacking reproductive rights, than Trump is.
142359	keeping the constitution intact, get a unbiased and ethical US Supreme Court,[CHAR(10)]and have a Supreme Commander who’s for the people and is not a lying criminal!
142360	She's the current vice president. She's smart, and has a great career.

210303	Harris is for the working public. She seems to care about everyone; Democratic or Republican. She wants to be President for ALL the people. 
210387	As stated previously, I prioritize human rights matters (e.g. LGBTQ+ care, immigration, reproductive rights, etc.) when selecting my candidate. Kamala Harris' proposed plans, such as protected abortion/IVF, preservation (and hopefully improvement) of inclusive sex education in schools, and economic policies that intend to support low income families are those that I wholeheartedly support and hope to see in legislation. Additionally, although I understand this could be a campaign tactic, I appreciate (as a Gen Z) her marketing and acknowledgement of Gen Z voters. A political candidate that recognizes and wants to support the upcoming generation is one that I can trust with my future. 
210544	I support the idea of having a female president and working to balance gender inequality in this country. I like the intention of many democratic policies to balance severe income inequality, racial inequality, and look out for those who are struggling/less fortunate. I like that Kamala (as far as I've seen) doesn't seem crass or rude, or have histories of sexual infidelity or crime. She could be more of a role model for people.[CHAR(10)]

210806	I agree with her views. 
210860	she’s been vp for 4 years and has not helped the economy 
210913	There are so many reasons, in my opinion, to vote for Kamala Harris as our next POTUS. I believe she sees a stronger future for our country, to narrow the divide between many backgrounds of people, to unify us as a nation of diversity and belonging. I am thrilled in her stance on the choice of women’s rights, her stance on LGBTQIA+ activism, and so many other topics. I like that Kamala has been a prosecutor and comes from a background that is unlike other democratic nominees prior to her candidacy. I like that she’s not afraid to voice her opinion, that she stands with the middle class, and that she is for the people. There are many reasons I am proudly voting for Kamala Harris for President, but most importantly, she has shown that there is hope for the future, for everyone. 
211030	She is for letting woman make choices about their own bodies. She intends to keep gay marage legal. 
211093	because it would be OK for a woman to rule as president because we had a queen as the ruler of the world and it worked out, she must rule with the iron fist and I would like to see that I have a mother and my mother has ruled over men for years and generations on emotional stand base and a great stand base so yes 
211099	She is a person of good character and integrity. I believe the policies of Biden are working post pandemic, it takes time.

She is not an egomaniac. She will not place us in danger with other countries. (Russia, China) She has political experience, she listens to the needs of the people, she is of sound mind and body, she is not looking for glorification nor seeking to become a dictator. She will have tremendous support from previous Presidents, aiding her along the way. With Kamala as President I won't have to go to bed at night worrying about thr state of our Union, if we sere going to be sucked in to a war, if anarchy would errupt the next day - all things I experienced when Donald Trump was in office. 
211336	Women’s rights. I want to make my own decision, with my doctors, regarding my personal health care.

211656	She isn’t trump and will live long enough to see the repercussions of her term 
211662	Trump is distrustful, Harris has a better chance of unifying the country 
211673	she is younger, more progressive, and is a woman.

211929	She seems much more sincere than her opponent.

212191	She would be the first female president, Her views on current affairs and issues in politics.

212405	she will defden democracy 
212423	Her prosecuting background and focus. 
212429	
212463	her beliefs on abortion 
212481	Ive seen her as a prosecutor and she really impressed me. she's a good person, level-headed very intelligent, and down to earth. She is for the people the underdogs.she is for everyone, not herself. I think she is very capable of doing the stressful job of President. Trump is just not capable and very concerning and down right scary. He is so mean hearted and disrespectful to anyone who doesn't praise him. He is not trustworthy! 
212487	I agree with her stance on important issues. 
212493	she is a democrat and she’s not a racist, Christian nationalist, billionaire or male 
212504	I never thought much about Kamala Harris when Joe Biden chose her to be his VP pick. I was very happy that she was the first woman Vice President. A woman of color to boot. That is something to be very proud of as an American. I know this old white guy was. But really I was just so happy that Joe Biden won the election that I really didn't give Kamala much thought. If she was good enough for Joe than I'm fine with it. The pandemic years were a fucking nightmare and one that I hope and pray I never have to revisit. After Trumps blatant mishandling of the pandemic I was elated that someone with a brain was in control. This whole year I have stood staunchly behind Biden. Never budging. I had no doubt that he could win again. I still think that. So reality did finally sink in when he stepped aside. I had to take a hard long look at my beliefs. I'm [REDACTED AGE], younger than Vice President Harris. Joe Biden is 81. He has to be over it. He has lived through some shit. So have we all. Him maybe a little bit more. Was pressure put upon him to bow out? I do not know. I do know that I will never watch another George Clooney movie EVER. That's not a hard thing to do. I never liked him anyway. So in comes Kamala Harris. Like I stated before, I knew very little about her. She was good enough for Joe so she's good enough for me. A very easy transition from my point of view. Then the political world EXPLODED! DAMN! Did not see that coming but so very happy that it did. What is that? A smile? Can we actually be Happy again? Did somebody just laugh? Is there excitement in the air? YES! BUT!!...We have to pick a running mate. I would have been fine with any of the people who were rumored to be in the running. I love Mark Kelly. A lot. Andy Beshear is great. I love Josh Shapiro's snarky attitude. Gretchen Whitmer? She has showed that she is Fearless! I respect her a great deal. Tim Walz? WTF? Who is this guy? My new best friend! That's who! Joe Biden let the horses loose and they ain't stopping. The excitement around this campaign is extraordinary. I am so very happy about this. The fearlessness that they have showed and the excitement that they bring is what brings America together. I know that am tired of the hatred, the fear mongering, the divisiveness. I have never lived my life in fear. I was not raised to be a racist or to hate anyone. I was raised to respect others and to work together. That is what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz do everyday that they are on the campaign trail. They bring people together. 
212581	I think more women need to in positions of power. 
212599	Kamala voted in favor late term abortion, open boarders, national health care and child care, loan forgiveness, and defunding the police which I am against all of those completely. Kamala is acting as a socialist and pushing for more and more regulations to be implemented by the federal government thus taking the power away from the people. 
212687	she is for the people and not a bigot 
212699	I think she's had 4 years to participate and observe in how everything operates in the White House and House of Representatives. She supported President Biden as a Vice President should. [CHAR(10)]Now she is ready to step from behind the scenes and become the forerunner that this country needs. I believe that she will be a great asset to this country! 
212842	honest, not constantly lying, genuine, lawful. 
212860	she makes sense 
212866	socialist bent and lack of experience. performed horribly in the primaries 4 years ago and is now the only choice railroaded through. 
212884	She has common sense , and a person that strives for the good of the working class 
212932	She's not self-serving, she's democratic, she's female 
212950	She is a woman, and she is not Trump, and will likely not try to take my rights away unlike him. 
212968	lack of border security, the cost of everything being so high. it’s difficult to survive on a retiree single income 
212998	Her energy, While i dont believe most high office canidates are n touch with lower and misdle class americans, i feel she is more knowledgable on what those of us in that category are dealing with. Also her stance on womens rights and health care 
213024	she’s smart, charismatic, qualified, and not crazy like Trump. 
213059	Previous political involvement in justice and understanding areas for improvement. Female reproductive rights champion. Strong-spoken candidate that cares about our international presence and allies. 
213094	she is not Donald Trump 
213135	I believe she has a youthful outlook for our country mixed with her experience 
213188	she is service all people[CHAR(10)]Trump only himself 
213294	she's seems very confident on what she wants for the people 
213429	She seems to always change her answers. Says one thing a few months ago, then changes whenever it is convenient. I also don't like democrat tax policy in general and weak on foreign affairs. 
213435	Once again, Americans are being forced to vote against a candidate rather than voting for one they prefer. 
213512	She is the lesser evil than Trump. While I do not support her sending money to Israel, I align myself with more of her policies. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I do not wish to vote for Harris or Trump. Our country is treating these past few presidential elections like they are sports teams instead of doing their research about what these politicians stand for. They are egotistical celebrities that do not care about the people in this country. They want us to fight. 
213524	I need a blowjob. 
213536	I think she has good policies 
213601	More of an all around person 
213607	She is not a felon.[CHAR(10)]Has not tried to overturn an election 
213631	woman of color, elegant speaker, for the people, democrat, is not Donald Trump 
213643	 So much, time for a lady, should have been Hillary.[CHAR(10)] She's smart, compassionate, has empathy 
213660	Her running mate is Tim Walz. Her policies align with my views. 
213666	She represents a breath of fresh air although she has been in the Biden administration for 4 years. I believe she will be able to stand up to lying bully Trump and cut him down to size. I think she has the American people in front of her mind and genuinely wants the everyone in the country do do better. 
213731	She is a Liberal Democrat. 
213845	shes not donald trump 
213875	she wants to change the abortion law

214075	democratic views 
214098	her leadership and how she would make the US a strong economy again 
214163	Everything. Her past policies are radical, she’s anti-Semitic, and she hasn’t answered one single serious question since being cast into the nominee position. I don’t believe she has any idea as to what it would take to successfully run a country. 
214216	she is not Donald Trump 
214243	Her support of women's rights and her background as a prosecutor following the rule of law.

214778	Respect for human beings. And I do think she can turn this country around without being a dicator. 
214962	my main concern is that Trump is NEVER president again. He is a divider, not a[CHAR(10)]leader. he broke our country in 4 short years. our country is ready for a women president. I stand with her on healthcare and immigration. 
214968	qualifications

215120	Would be nice to have a woman as president. 
215185	She’s mainly wanting to build the middle class by taxing the people who make $400k+ per year. Which will also help the lower class. I also value her reproductive health rights and other policies she has.

224800	She is not Donald Trump for one. I realize that there are different ways to solve the same problem, but I agree more with how she and her democratic colleagues will solve them than Trump and his colleagues. Harris and Walz are positive voices and bring a sense of rational thought to their proposed solutions. She is strong in her convictions and has the background and experience to put forth solid plans to solve these problems...at least those that can solved while she is in office and if she has the support of Congress.

224906	I can see this survey is getting me to answer the questions I did not want to answer earlier. So I'm answering the same for both candidates. Though I'm sure you can deduce my answer nonetheless. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I have never seen this country in such a divide politically and emotionally before. And I disagree with the violence, even if just verbal, that has resulted from such a divide. Back in 2003, the Dixie Chicks main singer made a comment about the then President. The backlash they received from that comment was wild. It ultimately took the band out. Now it's rendy to criticize our President as well as Presidential candidates. A song criticizing the President made it to #1 in the charts. Stickers, shirts, etc. being sold. I do not agree with this and so will not be party to this divide. I will vote, but I won't engage in a divide. 
224947	she has a good political agenda,she is a woman and she is for women 
224976	Fight climate change and reasonable abortion rights

225550	Kamala can protect America's interest from international laws and policies America comes up against. Eventually, other countries will begin to start using laws and policies against America. Kamala has a law degree that will help guide other legal scholars against opposing laws from other countries. 
225604	she is a strong well rounded POC that is a great choice to lead us. 
225616	I heard her platform and believe I will benefit from what she has to offer..no cuts in social security, try to pass border control bill, not raise taxes for middle class 
225634	Desire for unity of country and value of each individual for hope and improvement . A continuance of great programs begun by President Biden. Positive vs Negative. 
225681	I think her rich and prestigious background is what we need to bring back into the office. 
225699	She is running against Donald Trump, and she supports reproductive rights. 
225717	she would be a very good president for a woman

225758	Too much to list. 
225817	The policies that VP Harris espouses are far left progressive that lean into full blown Marxist/Communist ideology. Those policies have been proven to lead to failure of individual freedom and ultimately the country. 
225847	connection to community 
225924	lower food prices 
225972	Supports middle class Americans. Works to protect women's rights.

226490	all of her platforms 
226525	I want to trust her policies. 
226632	That she will put the best interest of the citizens first 
226638	she is honest and wants to help the American people do better in life. she is smart and will fight for women’s rights. 
226673	I believe Miss Harris is for the American people and the working class. She’s more respectful than Donald Trump has ever been in his whole life. And I think she would make an excellent president.

227044	She has integrity and honestly wants to help our country. 
227115	She promises to represent underserved communities. I also appreciate that the VP candidate is a former public school teacher. 
227151	She is a puppet and does not have the mental capacity to serve in any office, much less the Oval. My kids can form more rational thoughts than that idiot. 
227210	smart, nice to people, not Trump 
227258	She has been running the country for the last three and a half years due to having a President that has been incompetent to hold the position. If she admitted this cover-up, I might vote for her. If she had improved the security of our border and not allowed this immigrant invasion, I might have voted for her. If she didn't support this radical WOKE concept, I might vote for her. 
227400	She’s provided an economic policy, boarder crisis agenda, and is looking to move the country forward in unity.

235974	 Here is my answer that considers why someone might choose Kamala Harris over Donald Trump:[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]1. **Political Experience and Background**: Kamala Harris has a background in law as a former Attorney General of California and a U.S. Senator. Her experience in the judicial system and legislative process offers a different perspective compared to Trump's business-oriented background.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]2. **Policy Focus**: Harris has emphasized progressive policies on healthcare, climate change, criminal justice reform, and social equity. Her positions often align with those who prioritize social justice and environmental sustainability.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]3. **Leadership Style**: Harris is seen as a collaborative leader, often advocating for bipartisan efforts and coalition-building. In contrast, Trump’s leadership has been marked by a more confrontational style, which some feel exacerbates divisions.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]4. **Representation**: As the first woman, first Black woman, and first Asian American Vice President, Harris represents a significant step forward for representation in U.S. politics, which can resonate with voters who value diversity in leadership.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]5. **Global Relationships**: Harris's approach to foreign policy has generally emphasized rebuilding alliances and restoring international norms, while Trump's merica First approach often led to strained relationships with traditional allies.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]These points reflect why some might prefer Harris over Trump based on values, leadership style, and policy preferences.

327856	her platform for green energy. 
327994	She's a smart person. 
328240	i would say I feel like shes coming with a fresh perspective, new ideas and wanting to change a lot of bog business practices; theres alot af bog coperporations who have alot of tax breaks , leaving the middles class with less and Im hpng she can bring change to that; I feel that having a woman will not only bring hope for alot of people, but also being a woman of color will bring alot is recognition to our culture, because what has been in office has been alot of older, white men; i also feel that would also transpose to foreign cpuntries as well; alot of courntries look to us to see how things are goin, and us being progressive enough to have a colored, multiracial would be benficial to growth in our ,,, poeple look at us diferently, with negative views, an hipefully this will be someng difference.

330896	I like her policies, the thngs she says she wants to do but truthfully the biggest reason is to put it against Trump/AE/No 
330993	Womens rights

335043	diversify, being able lto have somone who is 59 years old a lot of people in senate and house of rep that are old and it sounds strange but she is younger and will have a better reach to younger people like myself and she is a woman and it is always better to have more .. to get the strongest opinion. 
335208	Man, I don't want to be flippant but she is not Donald Trump for one. She has a record of being tough when needed and she has a law background so she is well versed in the law. I think she was an attourney general. /AE/ No 
335445	Kamala is more intelligent, don't disagree with any policies or proposed policies, her view on women's rights to chose choices for their body, like proposed tax policies, immigration 
335788	she cares, and she wants to help people, she is about helping not taking. I think she will be a good president. 
336184	I think that she is more respectful of people and their needs and their aspirations. I think that her focus on raising the middle class is commendable and appropriate. I think she does have a leadership quality that her opponent does not. I appreciate her commitment to the military. I think that her econmoic policies would be more beneficial for the country. I have some trust in her that she will updhold the Consitition and the laws of our country. I like her position on NATO (North Amercian Treaty Organization) as a cooperative.

338097	she will be our first female president, we will be making history

I like that she has experience as the vice president, I don't know that much more about her, there's some policies of hers that I don't agree with in the past but I can't really think of any specifics right now. /ae/ I like that she's the Democratic candidate. I support her being chosen over Joe Biden for that. /ae/I think she's just a better candidate overall for President than Donald Trump. /ae/ No. 
341604	i think she has a more realistic approach 
341784	She's not Donald Trump /ae/ She's a Democrat /ae/ no 
341794	You know, it'd be nice to have a woman president but the Democrats, I'm just upset with, their just not making the right decisions for us /AE/ not really 
341846	She seems strong. Knowledgeable. Positive. Shes a democrat 
341906	She is supporting women's rights which I believe in /AE/ No 
341916	that she's a woman /ao/ not particularly 
342163	Her vice president and her age /AE/ Her experience /AE/ No 
342520	because she is united a wide a varity of situations one she is a woman two she is of color three is color the spectrum of fornors, she too me she covers that because she has forgein parents and she understand the working people of this country, she understands what they need/ao/ that will do it 
342690	her everything, policy, specifically womens rts, immigrants rts, ao/most of her policies, tax 
342766	new face, young, we need a change, AE NO 
342810	Experience. Policies. 
342862	She's a female /AE/ No 
343215	She was working class AEHer outcome on tax brackets AE 
343223	As a women, I umm feel that it is the right of woman to choose abortion if they want or need it. That is one of the things that could make me want to vote for her even though I'm beyond the years of needing any of that. /AO/ No 
343288	I like her foreign policy and I'm generally ok with raising taxes on the wealthy. I think her. Compared to Donald Trump she is much more presidential in her demeanor. 
343512	she's truthful 
343884	Some of the visions she spoke about during the debate, like her, what she wants for the nation to be equality for everyone, equal opportunties for everyone I do align with that. 
343894	well, she's not Donald trump, she's younger than Joe Biden,she has more energy than Joe Biden 
343994	she has a brain, I trust she can make solid decisions, I agree with her on many issues, I think she is a leader /AE/ that's good enough 
344010	She is a woman of color, again I mentioned that my [REDACTED FAMILY MEMBER] is african american. And as a woman I feel that putting her in office will help further the advancements of equal rights, equal pay, and most importantly in my opinion, the use of power when it comes to doctors. Lots of states have put bans on abortion even though the child may be conceived over rape or incest and they aren't given autonomy over their bodies. I feel that kamala might provide a little more autonomy over women and their bodies and their healthcare options. /AE/ Uh no. 
344251	She is the Democratic can/ running against trump, like her past goverment history/ like that she is a woman running/ but I do not know a lot about her/ ae/no

344488	Basically the opposite of Donald Trump; /ao/ more confidence in her adequacy for the demands of the job; /ao/ no. 
344543	I see the two candidates and for me there is not any choice. And now this guy Kennedy, but if its between Trump and Kamala...its Kamala. A/E No 
344826	she seems to have some good points against trump. To me they're all liars. To me Trump is just a jerk basically. Always been a democratic person. 
344859	She isn't Donald Trump, she has already been vice and has experience in office. She is a female and has different knowledge than a male might have 0n different issues. 
344977	that she is a black woman that makes me excited to vote for hwr also her back ground as a prosecutor attorney greneral and senator she has alot of backgroaund abut mainly the historiacal values.ao/no 
345194	Umm, I think that she has, umm, some valid or good like policies, like I don't think that one is all good or all bad. I just prefer more of Trump's plan. /AO/ No 
345218	She's a woman, I like her views, 
345337	I mean the easy ones, first female president, first Indian president, diversity in office is very important for young Americans to see, I guess all the bad things about Trump but opposite with her. Policy wise she's going to stop price gouging. Eggs are up a dollar more than needed. /AE/ No. 
345364	I would enjoy seeing a woman of color in presidency. It would be a pleasant change. /AE/ She's younger. Simply just because she's younger. Just as long as we have a president who isn't old enough to retire. That's so much better. If you were old enough to retire and you have no part of the economy you have no business running the economy. Fuck off, do your thing. /AE/ No. 
345378	Female, abortion rights, and other stuff she's so extreme... /ae/ no 
345491	well she seems ok trump always makes thimgs up to maker her look bad if biden chooses her she must okAo/ she has been street taught and collge ans school/ao/no 
345550	Her history coming up to the point now, she been a senator, a DA, her past experiences. A/E she come up the ladder. she appears very smart. A/E No 
345578	her commitment to individual rights, that she's not Donold Trump 
345802	I think that a woman and a woman of color being president is in and of itself a huge milestone, step forward, I appreciate her I hate to say it but alot of my reasons for voting for her is that she is not Trump, I think alot of her campaigh has been strategic as far as what statements she makes about her stances, her policies but I understand that need for strategy so I guess I'm trusting in her abilities/ae/she everything that I know about her says she's capable of this job and position/ae/ no 
345831	Reproductive rights/AE/ Personal freedoms and i have gone to go look at her stances but her immigration policies. those are the two primaries immigration and reproduction policies./AE/ i'm still researching but thats it. /AE/ no

346005	She's knowledgable about government issues. /AE/ Not right now no. 
346089	Her experience. /AE/ She's a woman, whenever you've gotta clean up a mess, send a woman to do it. We haven't had one yet, good change of face, well overdue. /AE/ I like how she's been keeping with the party, and doesn't spell out bullshit when her mouth opens. I do believe she's not a felon so that's a good thing, doesn't automatically assert that hating everyone who isn't white and male. /AE/ Isn't personally responsible for over 500,00 deaths from Covid-19. /AE/ No that's about it, I'm sure there's more but I can't remember for now. 
346116	I believe in women's rights, I also appriciate shes looking out for the blue collar workers instead of the rich billionaires, I like or approve her economic packages, I think she has a plan the opposition doesn't. And I believe she truly cares about the people, and this country, unlike the opposition who is only interested in himself and his vindictive unrealistic opionions. I think she's real, I think its time we have a younger president, and I believe that she is definitily up to doing the job, I think that she is going to be an approachable president meaning that she will be interested in what the people really think and what they really need 
346251	I think that the primary point is that she's not insane.it honestly comes down to that, the dems could run anyone and I would vote for them/AO/general party platform and outlook on social and economic issues/AO// 
346443	she's in favor of reproductive rights for women and union membership, strong unions, has a grasp of foreign policy /ao/ that's good, that's it. 
346515	she's a Democrat, also younger and will bring fresh energy /ao/ no I just really like her, she seems like she'll move the country foward /ao/ no 
346628	She just comes across more professional and knowledgeable in the way she speaks. There's less angry rhetoric compared to the republican party. They come across more angry and scaring people. /ae/ I think just traditionally the democratic party has been more immigration friendly and as an immigrant that resonates with me. /ae/ Nothing else is coming to mind. 
346786	She seems sincere AE 
346848	She was a prosecuter so she knows what shes doing. Shes a woman of color and I believe that her presidency will not get rid of racism but there will be consequences wheresas Donald Trump will be like stand by. 
346911	she is ready, she has worked for years for the people and what confirmed it for sure was that when the Hamas leader was killed she was very presidential in her announcement and very inclusive unlike a certain somebody else/ae/she has experience and intelligence enough to sort through complicated issues/ae/ no

347472	Reproductive rights is the main reason /ao/ The religious freedom /ao/ The taxing braket i fall under which is something I feel something the republicas help with./ao/ I think the Democratic partyu leans more toward helping the middle class./ao/ no 
347591	she seem to be as though she's gone be for the people, not just one race but for all /AE/ and she seem as though she's concerned about uh Medicare and Medicaid, and medicine prices or what have you /AE/ that' bout all I can come up with right now, from what I gathered she hadn't did her introduction speech yet and that's supposed to come sometime this week 
347759	The one and most important thing to me is that I can trust her/when she does something she explains why and if she cant do it she will explain why/the main thing is trust/shes got heart i think she cares/way back in the 2020 election to be honest if i thought she could beat biden i would have voted for her/AO//

349141	I've heard the some people consider her to not be Democratic but that she is Communist. But, I haven't yet studied her/ae/If she had a respect for the office of the presidency, I would have respect for her but when they abuse the office of the presidency, I would be inclined not to follow them/ae/no 
349275	Iegalize marjuana and decriminize. 
349491	When it comes to reoresentative of me and my behavior and how I would like to be represented as an individual Kamala holds many of those values. Respectful, well spoken, and I feel like she gives permission to disagree with her without name calling.

356927	I think the policies that she has laid in place already for her first 100 days in office are policies that I strongly aling with. Her running mate Tim Walz had policies that he put in place while he was the governer of Minnesota that strongly align with my beliefs. /AE/ I would also say I believe Kamala Harris is more likely to create equality and reduce the tension between the two major parties.

Tim also is fantastic vice presidentioal selection, really bolsters the ticket. /AE/ No. 
357680	She spent her all career in public service, She has been there for the last 4 years as a vicepresident, She understand the responsabilities that is been president of US. AO, She is a lot more fun that Donald Trump 
357891	Not Donald Trump. She has a brain in her head, seems like she has some kind of functional ability to play the game. 
358067	she reads from the teleprompter/AE/she has a generally kinder disposition on the surface/AE/no 
358072	not watching her as much as the president, and have not paid atteniton to debates /ao/ dk

358730	Reproductive rights, LGBTQ-IA rights, health care, expanding the Affordable Care Act, tax cuts for the middle class, in terms of foreign affairs, more pro cease fire than Biden; environment is a big one for our family, lowering emissions, reducing our carbon footprint. /AO/ Those are the big ones. /AO/ I think you know, immigration, i think she is more prone to carve a path for immigrants to come here and become citizens of the US as opposed to her opponet. /AO/ I like to think, this kinds of goes to tax cuts, big corporations, making it a more fair economy and having a large checks and balances system, so they're not just putting money in the pockets of CEOs and she's pro middle class, pro union, things like that. /AO/ No. 
358765	That would be her views on gun control. She and Joe Biden have worked hard to pass common sense gun laws. Yeah, and I feel like Kamala cares more about the epidemic of gun violence in America, specifically those commited with assault riffles. And then secondly her views on abortion I agree with more than Trump. In terms of social welfare programs, I'm actually using one right now that's helping me and I feel that her party.. her policies regarding government assistance programs are more aligned with my views. /AO/Yeah, I feel like she is more respectful to immigrants and those that are not from here, she's more respectful. /AO/ No 
358767	shes giving off better vibes, her vibes are more towards people when she talks instead of just talking to the people/ao/no 
358780	I would say shes pro middle class./ao/ not really 
358797	Abortion stance and interest in like a bottom up perspective from local communities up and how government is structured /ae/ That is all 
358891	the way she presents herself as a person and the things she speaks on /AE/ No

359197	She would keep the social security intact AE 
359280	her stance on alot of political issues like female rts, her track record 
359299	She is not Donald Trump. She would be a good president 
359322	She is inelligent she is bi-racial, she is caring, a woman, educated, seems to be a caring person. 
359345	experince she has, attorney general, senator and vice presitent she has done the steps.

359760	Calm. That's it. /AE/ For her no. 
359839	To start with she's not Donald Trump /ae/ I'm trusting the fact that she is democratic and the truth is i haven't been following very deeply her values so I'm giving a lot of trust to her outspokenness and I'm coming from a place of not wanting donald trump to win /ae/ the fact that she is female and a woman of color, but just because someone has identities doesn't mean they are on the side of people, but i'm trusting that she is /ae/ Not right now 
359848	she beleives inpeople tha are mddile to lwer class,wo are suffering the most right now ae/tat kind of sums it up 
359989	I see politically she's very intelligent, she's very caring, she cares about the people, I could tell, she's been there, she's vice president and knows what's going on, she knows, I'm not sure how to word it, she knows the issues. /AE/ she's got good ideas to run the country /AE/ I don't think so. 
360129	I think she is smarter and wiser and more stable than Donald Trump./ae/It's tricky because I grew up in a deeply republican home in the midwest and so it's easy for me to see both sides. so while many are voting for Kamala because of women's rights, I try to look at the bigger picture and in the bigger picture, she is the better candidate/ae/no 
360194	She has supported Joe Bindes policy, everpresent , so she knows the leagal in and outs because she was a district attorney, she seemed when she got covere she able to speak in a forthright manner about Joe Bidens policy with understanding, real clear to what was going on in the executive branch. 
360494	Abortion rights. That's the thing. /ae/ That's the main thing. That's why I don't want to vote for Trump. 
360536	Just because she's Democrat actually, I've just been raised that way /ae/ no 
360636	she seems to be bring in unity /ae / she will have a well balance to approce / ae / no

360996	Que cumplanlas promesas que prometen. Va uno a votar Y luego no se ve nada de lo que se prometio./ao/ No 
361162	She's runnin against donald trump /ae/ no 
361563	because she ocmes from a stron political bacnkground and i generally like her/ao/ i think its the things she and biden are doing have been really good for the past 4 yrs/aono

361718	mainly because shes a middle class person, She comes across as being a real person, not tied up in politics. She seems like an honest person, she's worked hard all her llife and I respect that. And i like the messages she gives out. Trump favors the corporate world giving them tax credits, and kamala doesn't seem to be that kind of person. the fact that she's not white should not be held against her at all. 
361853	she is just she and joe biden have have been doing a great job/i like her i think her and joe biden will preserve democracy and i hope she doez something about guns i hope her justice department steps up to the plate morte than joe biden has/ao/she is like for womans rights/ao/no 
361932	like joe biden will try to protect the middle class, donal trump got rid of the clean water act that obama put in place , . theyre not gonna raise taxes for the middle class . 
362218	I think she has a career in public service as a U.S attorney. She has been a public servant, She leans left but shes not a super libral person, she is younger than some of our recent canadidates, i think that her policies align with my values. /AO/ Abortion also a big factor/AO/I think thats mostly what comes to mind

362848	she claims she is doing more stuff she is not piclking at the peopl. donald trump is harrassing and calling the people names we dont need apresident like that/ao/no 
362976	She is running against donald trump /ae/ she has integrity /ae/ she is articulate /ae/ sounds good /ae/ No

363801	I think she presents well and intellectually articulates responses to questions instead of incorherant babbling that people do. She is yes on 3 which I am in support of. I know the other side is yes on 3 from what I have seen. She is woman which I would hope and assume would lead to her pushing women's rights. And she seems to be alot of times when cadidtates are asked questions they dont want to answer they do a lot of side skirting and she doesnt seem to do that. I like that. It at least portrays being genuine. I think that is probably it. I don't know a whole lot on what she is pushing for. It would be historical not that that alone would decide my vote, but her being a good candidate makes that an extra bonus I suppose. /AE/no

364684	Her values are more aligned with either my bwliefs or what I hope for the country. And she of the 2majors parties I believe that she can handle the hob better. Shes a better leader. Donald Trump already had the job. I dont think he should have. I think shes going to move our countryforward in a more positive less devisive fashion.

I was very dissappointed when dropped out, i loved his quiet competence, since Kamala came in, I have been continually impressed by her high energy and positive attitute and her joyful competence and her ability to really articulate plans for America, she is the positive candidate, and DT is the negative candidate. Besides being convicted felon, adjudicated rapist, fraudster. I use to live in [REDACTED STATE] and I remember his 3 bankrupcies and stiffing workers and contracters.

Although I don't like the okeness like gender issues, LTBTQ, I don't like; some of the things like - there's too much Hindu phobia going on right now; I don't like that; they pick up issues selectively. A/O That's basically it; Trump has not given any explanation of how he will bring down inflation; he will do the same; he'll cut taxes for the rich and we'll have worse inflation, two years, three years, later. A/O That's it. I was watching his meeting with the black journalists and he was specifically asked a question about how he will bring down inflation and he kept going on and did not answer question; he keeps making nasty, ugly comments. He (rump) says everything he (rump) is great.

383155	I like how she's younger and let's see. She looks like she's more willing to compromise. That's about it. /AE/ No. 
383424	I like the way she presents herself, some things I agree with, some things I don't, I had to look back at her whole campaign but anyone running against Trump I'll pick them over Trump anyday /AE/ and his abuse of power /AE/ that's it 
383480	i believe that she actually believes that governmet can be good ae/ she's gnrally honest and empthetic ae/ compasssionate ae/ thats good 
383739	She is for the most part seems to be more organized. A lady as a president would do a good job / ae/ no

385243	the thing is she was the first woman of color and hense I would have oted for her 
385696	With her concern for the american people regardless of their monetary status she is for everyone especially the middle class and that (I missed what R said and he didn't remember. He then went on and said): her knowledge of how the government works. /ae/ just that she follows through on what she told the american people. /ae/ No 
385932	I think she's positive and talks about what she's going to do./ae/I thihnk positve thoughts but her./ae/Her past jobs will help her a lot./ae/no. 
386140	she seems like I have more of an inclination to vote for her than Biden.f She seems to have a pretty level/head on her shoulders. She thinks before she says something too.

She seems like she might make it a point, she might have a drive to do things Biden didn't do, make her political standpoint may be a stronger person than she's given/

387170	her value of modern families that was raised in the united states and raised in poverty and earned a honest living and not giving money through inhertinance does not believe in the rich get richer and poor gets poor. Believe for her rights for women to make their own decision.

387656	i think shes speak a lot better and seems to have a good temperment/ao/no 
387657	She's a lot younger. She was a presecutor so she's porbably gonna be tougher on crime. I don't really know what her other things are yet because she hasn't been in office. And in today's election it's hard for anybody to pass anything between the house and the senate. /AE/ That's enough. 
387859	She is more pro immigration and is better with queer and trans issues and yeah that's the end of what would make me want to vote for her actually 
387918	Her experience. /ae/ professional journey. /ae/ her record. /ae/given that I would have voted for biden's corpse, she is running against trump. /ae/no

388667	Her way of peaking, her ideal, how she wants to change what is not been working for the middle class. a lot of credibilty a prosecutor, she was a senator, and its time for our country to be run by a woman. she can make smart decition, she has class, the way she chose the VP, dont allow to things afect her like DT her moral and standard 
388827	she needs to pick a side as far as what it is she wants to do feels as though she goes with the wind at times and she is just a talker no faith she will have actions besides her words 
388898	I like the way she say she will stick up for the middle class low class, but not if sure if she will follow though. 
388929	shes a good communicator , shes a good orator/ao/ no 
388996	i believe sh is an honest intellegent alternative. utimately she woill do the better job of any of the other candidatws out there. i do think she has the ability and dont want to say the lesser of 22 evils but she is the better canoidate./ao/no
