Quit allowing politicians from being bribed(quite easy to find out)
We are being over taxed and the tax money is being spent in the wrong places.

The cost of living has become an apparent problem in this country. The inability to be able to afford a steady foothold in financial stability from homeownership. The inability to save for retirement in any meaningful way is a problem. 
It's not right what this man is prioritizing when he gets sworn in. Other countries don't fear him so much. We are seeing inflation from past tariffs and the sink hole he put us in financially.  I truly worry with Ramaswamy and Musk being in charge of what seems to me, dismantling our government as we know it. This country is in for a rude awakening with the wool all of these men just conned the people to believe they promise.  I truly worry about our freedom to vote again.

So when they increase your food stamps by $2.00 whoohoo lets jump for joy. Did you know every time social security recipients who get food stamps get a cost of living raise get their foods cut so it actually ends up hurting them. If you get a $20.00 raise they take $25.00 away in food stamps. where is the benefit in that?

Fix the immigration laws to be able to accomodate people who want to enter.

I think it's important make the country better 
Donald Trump's Presidency
I think the most important problems facing this country are partisan media coverage posing as news, lack of good leadership qualities in elected and appointed officials, lack of economic opportunity for the middle and lower classes, lack of common-sense gun laws, disrespect of women, intolerance toward minorities, and lack of environmental protection. I cannot name just one.

I'm not good with terminology like my husband is but I'll explain in the best way I think. Our economy and the price of living, when it comes to food, homes, taxes, vehicles, everything has drastically gone up since Biden. I don't want to hear libs say it happened with Trump when his last year we had a world wide pandemic. racism is the worse it's ever been since back in the day. not all, but most black people believe we owe them something today because of how their ancestors were treated. The racial divide the media puts out there for them to hate white people and to act like they're so much better. government assistance. There is no incentive to work when Shanaynay from Baltimore has 4 kids and no job and can live on sections 8 and $1500 in food stamps a month using our tax dollars.

Then you have to decide on having dinner on the table, with all the utilities you have to pay or the medical attention you need. Not to mention all the Taxes on everything have skyrocketing!!!!
The division and hateful behavior of the American people. 
Education and the lack thereof - people are using less critical thinking and more consuming of quick and probably wrong information
Financial stability for the every day person. Ex housing, food prices/quality etc
wealth gap between CEOs/management and working class people
At this point I think the biggest problem is that political parties have lost the objective: they care more about winning and less about policy. Over and over again we see parties put themselves and their members ahead of country or even good policy. Political parties are the biggest problem. Cult of personality is closely related. After those two, our biggest problem is the rolling back of social justice policies - rolling back protections and freedoms for Americans rather than protecting or expanding freedoms.

Right now, the biggest problem facing this country is Donald Trump.  He will have unbridled power and looks upon himself as a king/dictator. He wants to appoint loyalists to the most important positions in the country for which they are not qualified, which is dangerous. I think the lack of abortion access and related health issues for women is the second most important problem.  Trump will harm this country for years to come in ways that we haven't even imagined yet.
no unity. the U S is severely split between Republican and Democrat. like a terrible civil war may be coming.

The two-party political system forces people to choose candidates that they only agree with on one or two issues that are important to them. They are forced to support other positions the candidate from that party supports even though the voter may not agree with it because there is no other choice. Also, the Electoral college does not count every person's vote equally.

He is a risk to people and there family's lives no matter what group Dems or Rep . I know he has a problem and maybe he cant help it that's why he has to be dropped as President right now before he puts us into a nuke war. Obama needs out to for he is the one who told other country's to come hear and we take care them. Plus we dont need a gay President we need a nuturl one.

Every student who are US citizen coming from senior high schools or universities must get a job, instead of foreign MS students, whose countries education system is par below the USA education standard.  Most of these foreign students coming here (based on visa luck and showing fake bank account to US consultancy office) and doing master's and putting fake experience in their resume and grabbing the jobs, through consultancy agencies. Mostly these consultancy agencies are on salary commission bases and encouraging the foreign MS students to create the fake resume and through their hierarchy channel (consultancy friends) in that companies, they are helping this foreign MS students getting the jobs, which BADLY hurting the USA citizens jobs opportunities. THIS MUST be stopped immediately.   The people who running these consultancy agencies in USA, came from villages landlords or corrupt officers/politician/film industries, and mostly they are having religious background people and hurting the Chirstian minorities back in India (for example).  After getting the commissioned money from MS students, these consultancy agencies are doing real estate here in USA and increasing the home price and looting people here in USA.  They (consultancies) are helping by running parallel economy in USA to help corrupted politician back in India.   The best solution for this problem is 1.scrutinize the education background while giving visa. 2. NO off campus jobs (doing in consultancies motels/restaurants) 3. directly hire them through USA company with reasonable salary (where consultancy charging 10 time higher).  4. if these MS students are too good, provide green card to them without delay.   In this way, it will not hurt USA citizens jobs, mostly they complete their studies with bank loans, and they are able to repay that money if they have jobs in hand.   It only possible when US government set down fake consultancy business, in that way US government helping (1) the right-minded (knowledge) MS students for jobs and preventing them from slavery, (2) helping the innocent people not to fall in consultancy real estate fake business, and (3) back in India, helping the Christian minorities to practice their religious with freedom. (4) IRS will get tax money by prevent parallel running economy by this consultancy for corrupted politicians back in India. Here I taken India as example. The situation is more or less similar to every country particularly Asia, Africa and Latin Americas.

With the election of Donald J. Trump to be the next U.S. president the very foundation of our freedom and democracy hangs in the balance. Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with and has appointed to his 2025 cabinet only YES" people. Not loyalists, per se, but "yes men." People who will assist him in his revenge against the DOJ for filing felony charges against him for his illegal and outrageous behaviors in January of 2021 and revenge against the FBI for raiding his Mara-a-Lago Club in search of absconded classified documents he had stashed away there. Because the Supreme Court has granted Mr. Trump full immunity for "all official acts" during his upcoming term in office, he now has no guard rails in place to check his promise of revenge against his "enemies." With the nomination of people like Pete Hegseth as the Secretary of Defense and Kash Patel as the Director of the FBI, Mr. Trump now has a clear and unindictable pathway to the end of the "Rule of Law" as we know it today and his accomplishment of his primary mandate to become a dictator. This clear threat to the United States Constitution (which Mr. Trump has never read) puts our current freedom and democracy at severe risk. "

I don't know if this is the most important problem, but I do think it is a big one. For me to think what the most important thing America faces right now I would have to think a lot longer and harder than I am willing to dedicate to this. I think a huge problem right now is the anti-American sentiment across the country. This goes both sides. The right hates the left the left hates the right. The left is more adamant that all American cultures and things America does it the worst thing in the world. The right hates where America is going and honestly more anti-American because they are willing to overthrow the government in order to put their leader into power because of the mere mention that it could have been a hoax when there was no significant evidence to show the voting in 2020 was bad. There is a huge divide in the country right now and we cannot come together to fight for America as a whole, every side claims the other is anti-American and in a sense they are both right. I think that if some country were to invade us right now (this would never happen but most likely would be Russia or China) the right or left would abandon the country because they would think the invaders have every right to invade us because we are such a bad entity in the world and how America is the worst thing ever. I think this is sham and America is actually the greatest. I just think right at this moment we are not showing it.

Immagration is a huge problem. The number of people here illegally is a huge burden on our economy. They are also a huge part of the problem with the lack of fair wages. They are a burden on the healthcare system. Eventually it causes higher prices making it harder for citizens to have decent healthcare. Immigrants are a huge drain on everything in the United States. It isn't fair to people that migrate here and go through the proper channels to do so. Plus it is not fair to all the people who had to pay to become citizens.

I believe the greatest problems facing this country are the increasing gap between the top 4% of Americans and the rest of the country. I grew up middle class and as a full time employee now, I remain middle class but I see myself slowly shrinking closer to poverty than my parents had growing up. I also think the potential abolishment of the Department of Education is a giant threat for this country and we will see an increase in Americans defaulting on these loans or bankrupting. Finally, I fear for the rate of inflation under Trump as tariffs begin.

I believe there are a couple of major problems our country is going through at the moment. First, the amount of money and support we are giving Ukraine. Handing them missiles to fire into Russia is a plot of the Democratic Party trying to cause more issues for Trump. and second would be the DEI hires. Hire the best person for the job not based off what they look like or whatever mental illness they have such as identifying as transgender.

Priorities of national interest: I don't believe that immigrants are as big a problem as poor education, unequal access to healthcare, and crumbling infrastructure including water, energy, and roads. There's too much focus on anti-transgender, anti-â€œwokeâ€, and anti-immigrant.
I don't understand the wording of this question. I'm supposed to list the most important problems, and if I only came up with one I don't have to briefly name it?

Am. elected a convicted criminal as President and a man who meets Am. Psychiatric Assn. Diagnostic Criteria for both Antisocial and Narcissistic Personality Disorders.  Right wing media has been very successful in their business model of fomenting anger/resentment by mis. and disinformation.  The tipping point was when the Republican Party reached their goal of Alternative Facts."  Social Media has also been poisonous in regard to "fact-checking."  American is moving toward right-wing oligarchy.  Working class people are voting against their own interests.  Democracy is at a dangerous tipping point.  "

I think there is an extreme divide in the beliefs people hold and some extreme constitutionalists based on religion. I remember learning about the separation of church and state in grade school and it feels like the government has been the exact opposite of that. There's problems on both sides (please why can't we get away from the bi-partisan party options) but when it comes to basic, common sensical human rights, people have God in mind and/or their personal beliefs instead of leaving it up to the individual. Unfortunately many of these people hold such vile and violent opinions it's disheartening. I understand our country was built on certain ideals but thankfully we have toilet paper (or wait, did electricity come first?) these days and no longer have to write with a feather pen on scroll paper so why is it so important to some people that our ideals stay in the past?

I live in the USA. I would say we have a few great issues. Poverty, homelessness, and treatment of the disabled. First poverty and homelessness can be handled similarly. We have a TON of empty abandoned homes all over the usa. Put those non-violent folks in a home. If it is a large home you can put singles in it as a shared option with life coaches supervising. Make ALL of them continue education and do a vocational or job training option (even the disabled who want to work). Limit the number of children that they can have while getting assistance (ends the ones having kids to keep/get more benefits). Have EVERY single one of the adults in a program geared towards education, life skills, counselling, drug prevention/rehab, and work/skill programs. Also make accessible feeding programs in EVERY community with transportation to get there. Things would change fast if this group felt there was hope.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Second lets talk about the disabled. Here many of us are treated worse than criminals or the homeless. We are ignored. Many of us want to work. Employees see us as too much of a â€˜liability'. It does not matter how well we are trained. Many won't even talk to us about the possibility of a job. This needs to change. Give us training (vocational rehab is a joke where i am), life skills, and tools needed to be able to work. Put us in a job that is in our field choice and make it so there's a probationary period so we can PROVE that we can work just as hard, if not harder, than anyone else. Make it easier for us to go to college!

The Oligarchy now in full power and their plans to destroy democracy and America as we know it.
1 focus on what your job is, roads and the taking care of the state tell the environmentalists get out of politics. Fires are burning the state because we are not allowed to clear.
Pro life vs pro choice, 2nd amendment rights vs. school shootings, widening gap between the wealthy and everybody else, political war for power instead of at least an attempt to govern, media fueled distrust of everything
interest rates and housing prices
Conservative ideology and actions
The attempt to destroy democracy by the Trump Administration will end our system of the rule of law, checks and balances and three bodies of government that monitor and check each other. Trump is becoming a autocrat. I am terrified. 
trump's agenda
climate change how the plante is warming and how to stop it
Treating everyone as humans with basic rights, but that covers a lot, so I will simplify to education. The reason our country is in trouble is due to the lack of education on how our government actually works. Our education system is broken and it is only going to get worse over the next 4 years.
There's a few, but the fact that rich get tax breaks and the working class is taxed more is creating a huge gap where the majority is living in poverty or one check away for being bankrupt. Prices are too high. The new administration is probably going to make it worse and put the blame on others. 
we no longer understand what a democracy is under the rule of Law. We have grown lazy in communicating truth and understanding of Our Constitution
misappropriation of funds. enabling mentally diseased people. allowing people to benefit from the government by acting like victims. 
immigration, food prices, rents and housing prices, and the economy in general.
Donald Trump, his billionaire allies and the stupidity and ignorance of the American people.
Economy.  I'm concerned about inflation. The cost of groceries and expenses in general.
I feel the most important problem facing us now is illegal immigration.  It has caused major problem with horrible criminals and police that have been crimpled.  it has caused major problems for hospitals and for Americans trying to use them, schools, housing and cities trying to house them. 
Decline of public education
homeless, plan to help homelessness or eliminate.
I could write an entire essay- Biggest problem we have is Donald Trump and the people in congress and senate who consistently lie to the american voters. Scotus is a huge problem, as well. we need ethics for  scotus. Electoral college should be eliminated. Roe put back into place. Lobbyists- politicians are getting into office and then selling out the american people. Our politicians need to be barred from taking financial gain from their offices. Gun should not have more rights than little kids. I could go on all day but..you get the picture. Democracy is dying over lies.

Financial struggles 
The difficulty in achieving a comfortable and stable life, and the current misunderstanding and hate that people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, and a vast majority of the population receive, and how as a country we feel afraid to voice ourselves and our beliefs simply because there is a chance someone could disagree and attempt to deface you or in some cases physically hurt you. This country hates anyone besides the majority, and its been perpetuated by the upper classes piting us against each other.

Bills are higher than paychecks. Most people who work full-time cannot afford life. We work 40-50 hours weekly (many are working a lot more) and many of us are struggling to pay rent and all our bills. If we're spending most of our week in dreadful places, away from our families and peace, we should at least be able not to worry about our bills.

Secondly, the way they want t handle immigration....so afraid of the guy that comes from Guatemala or Mexico..all they want to do is pick tomatoes or lettuce....we should be very afraid of Murdoch, Musk and Thiel....those are the immigrant that have turned this  country into their control... and that is just for starters

illegal immigration 
Immigration has been squashed by the Kamela and Joe Biden. We're overrun by illegals, houseing is short and our tax dollars are being spent to feed & house them, along with medical care.

income inequality
Division within
1. The wide gap between the Dem and Rep parties. Both parties seem self centered and are constantly pointing fingers at each other. 2. Self-centered, often arrogant, Congressmen who lead" based on personal values and/or benefit. 3. How everything is blamed on "fake news" how are we supposed to know what is real news/information. 4. The economy - the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Some folks are just excessively rich while the middle-class continues to struggle. 5. Home ownership, and even the ability to rent a house, is out of reach for SOOO many people, even for those who work. 6. Related to that is AFFORDABLE housing; landlords basically charge whatever the market will bear and those with lower or fixed income are left (literally) out in the cold. 7. Immigration (not referring to Mexico); out of country tuition is beneficial to schools but then graduates get the high-salary jobs. "

illegal immigration- there was no border for 8 years. free for all
Niche news and the proliferation of mis-information and disinformation. America is not currently an effective decision-making body, at any level.
Trump; i dont think Trump...he loves this country, but he loves himself more
the economy; well people are having trouble making ends meet, prices have gone up, and the government has spent trillions of dollars we dont have, and we have seen no results
The border. /ms/ It's open. Open border.
Low pay rates/tm/it's a problem. They are payikng people very low wages.
inflation- prices are too high, cost of living
DontKnow
Economy, inflation pricing for some one my age. 
poverty, there is so many people who have good jobs and have money and so many who dont. .they cant afford to eat and cant afford to care for their children.
Economy; I think that people have gotten used to wanting lto live foff the government and not work. More people hae handouts and dont want to work for what they have.
Border Solving  those issues is a problem.
Probably right now is the cost of housing and living going up. /AE/  It's impossible for young couples to buy a house. Unless they are making bank it's impossible for them to buy a house and afford cost of living.  /AE/ No
Abortion rights, the increase in restrictive laws /AE/ No that's it
border security; too many illegal aliens
the illegal immigration, cuz people are coming into the US and murdering people here and they're allowed to stay, we have enough murderers here, I just don't agree with it because I'm sorry your country is a terrible country, but you just get to jump the border and come here I'm sorry but I don't agree with that at all /AE/ No
inflation; the fact that inflations has increased steading at 18% since covid; and that we are printing money to cover debt; the has icluded millions in poverty, and adjustments are necessary on regulation; no one is getting paid enough; teachers and gov't officuals
crime/housing/ jobs/ crime is on the raising/ affordable housining is not avaible / ne
I think probably just border control is big issue and problem and probably health care, I think just my opinion just how either parety or Governemtn could handle it better, um yeah. The solution. 
Inflation, driving up the cost of living /AE/ no
Refusal
Crime. Too much killing. /ae/No.
Violence
Immigration /tm/ disorganized /ao/ just needs to be upgraded I mean overhauled I am in favor of immigration thats about it I guess
Racism./AE/No.
Education, I don't believe that people are learning what they should learn, I think there's practical things that people don't learn for example finances and how to do your taxes, I just feel like they learn other things that don't matter /AE/ I think they push agendas of political viewpoints or social viewpoints into public schools, that's one of the things that don't matter, learning practical things is what matters /AE/ Not really
Oh wow ,this country , I would say the educational system is a problem, based on lack of interest/seriousness/funding, as opposed to truly educated people. Then there is not really education people to think critically
housing, jobs and wages specifically, inflation, um and food prices. /problem with housing/ the amount of steps /requiremtnes to own them specifically credit scores and how hard it is especially in Austin to get a home, a lot oh homeless people
divide over what is true, and how to assertain truth
hatred /tm/ think that there is both amongst the politcal leaders and politcial parties a concerted effort to foment hatred rather than patriotism and untiy 
Divisiveness. People are separating into groups like black lives matter, like we're this or we're that. We're pulling together as a cohesive group. yeah everybody's stressing their little personal matters as opposed to what's god for the country.
One problem is political direction of the supreme court /probe/ the conservative intreuppertation of the constititution favors big business it over individuals. for instance big business has personhood. one of the more recent decision about the president being any duties or any decissions or actions taken in the course of his or her being president can not be prosictued forI think that is dangerous and lack of accountability for the president 
The border first, then inflation. Uncontrolled invasion.
Illegal immigration. The federal law applicable to immigration has not been followed because of failure of enforcement by the federal branch of goverment and has in fact been encouraged--and that is being told you by an immigrant, myself.
I would say inflation, the price of groceries.
The economy / TM / The price of everything has gone up like crazy over the past 4 years, it wasn't like that 4 years ago, I have a family of [REDACTED NUMBER] and I feel that
La economia
Immigration; that too many illegals coming in; /ae/ they should be able to get a green card if they want to.
The for profit prison system. Mass incarceration and prosecutor insentives. 
uh, immigration /P/ um, I don;t have a probem with these people coming in but they need to go through the paperwork and get approved before, just like its always been done, my father came up and saw the statue of liberty and he did the paperwork, you don't just walk over the line and say I am an american, you gotta go through the steps, that's all / AE/ um, well i thought it was great when the guy from texas was bringing people up to New england, i thought that was fantastic, because those people weren't getting it, but I don't like they can just come in and get themselves a liscenes, and I think they can vote now, they can get a job and a car and nobody has a problem with it;  /AE/  uh no, it's not 1885 anymore
Economy, the money has costs have just gotten so high so hard especially for younger people starting out and middle class retirees
Homeless/tm/There are not enough funds for them, low funds to find them a place.
Immigration. Close the borders. Letting too many people in that have not gone through the process of the law to be an american citizen. I welcome them 100% but nope I do not go for the others, it's against the constitution. 
The biggest problem is getting away from religion /tm/ taking prayers out of schools and just, seems like more, what I believe in is less, people think less of it, like religion and the pledge of allegiance and all that that was very important and is not important to the younger generation, or most of them /ao/ no
Supreme Court too ultra conservtive, tied to MAGA movement, overturning 50 years laws to slow in handling decisions that were easy to decide,  no oversight  on ethics on individual justices, should be terms limits.

Fairness, <laughed> fairness I mean like some of the programs and their generosity is given to one race, one set of people, have you seen the news this morning or yesterday?

la economia, no esta balanceada
Economics. /ms/ Just inflation, just the economy as a whole.
The environment/tm/I think the fact that we're...I think that we're running into issues such as earthquakes, fires, temperature fluctuation, and focus is being drawn away from the environment and we're up against time to come up with solutions.

Division is the worst /tm/ yeah, how do I put that... there's too much division between the different people, the blacks, the whites, the koreans, chinese, all of those, there's too much division, we are one country, and everyone is the same as a citizen /ao/ basically that's it. We need to go back to the constitution and get rid of all of the people in any kind of an office who does not coincide with the constitution
Divisive people have become.

High prices /probe/ they are too high, people can't afford a lot of stuff anymore
The economy is a big thing right now, as far as congress is concerned they're leaning to the wrong things to handle them and a lot of them are favoring big business and certain multimillionaires and they're not thinking of the people  and the average joe /AE/ Too many greedy people involved /AE/ That's it
The food prices theres no sense in those food prices being that gosh damn high. Gas prices too. gas prices are freaking high too. Think those are two main things that need to go down.

Government spending. Is the cause and reason why we have inflation. Its also They shouldn't spend more money than they take in. Like we have to balance our check book, they should balane their check book as well. Sending money overseas needs to stop and end. We need to help our own citizens first. There needs to be a reduction in government employment and cutting our government spending.
different realities/tm/there is only one objective truth, having two different realities inherently does not make
The taxes to the rich and corporations, I think it's unfair to the regular person.
the justice department, not holding people accountable who are crimnals, not holding Trump accountable

misinformatio
Let's go with, the economy. /ms/ Inflation; my primary concern with the economy.

  a lot of americans cant afford their medicine elderly and people doing crooked stuff and getting  away with it .
the division of the population, /tm/ donald trump 
DK
I think that would be employment of citizens. I think that we have people coming in from other countries and their taking jobs that American could be working at. I think that's even at all levels because those who are in the higher office, even like CEOs, creating businesses or  taking over the businesses. From overseas, they are interested in taking care of family people from home. Where if an american has a job they would be focused on Americans, people here. It would increase our employment level in the states. And then people in general would be happy. 
Healthcare, women's health specifically /probe/ lack of abortion and the heartbeat law the lack of research into women's healthcare and the lack of accessability i you are not workin
Supression of freedom, failure to uphold the Constitution. I see in both our personal lives and our community lives deficiancy in freedom and responsibility. Good decisions are best made where there is freedom -Albert Einstein. 
income equality , a lot of people cant afford to live.
misinformation/ media bias /ae/ it is difficult to educate a populous or get them to think freely when the facts are intentionally obscured or only favorable information is given or withheld by the nations most viewed news sources /ae/
our border, it was an open door for too long
Economics. It just, the prices are going wild. 
Illigal immigration, not following the rules and what it costs /AE/ No
Illegal immigration/tm/there are too many people coming in the country illegeally and with criminal backgrounds. that is a problem. we already have enough criminals we odn't need anymore. The crime problem is a big problem. I understand people want to come because of hardshp. Too many peoplea re ocming over and expecting us to support them and that is ahuge problem that makes me mad. they are wanting Social Security beneifts and they havent paid into it. Me and my husband have been paying and probably won't get to use it
Foreign relations, what's going on in the Ukraine and North Korea and Russia. We have i think more tensions than we ever had since previouse wars. We don't have good leaders that are good at diplomacy. 
Extremists. /probe/ Too many far right and too many far left. But mostly too many far right.
Illegal Immigration. There's a lot of illegal immigrants coming over with no reprocion. /AE/ Drugs due to illegal immigration. /AE/ That'll be good.
All this racism going around now. Even got a President be a racist President. He's a racist, trust me. They're Clan. Look 'em up. He didn't say sh** about blacks. That man ain't going to help us. All those court cases: he want his money back. That's it.
I would say authoritarian foreign governments like China and Russia/tm/Russia's invasion of Ukraine is frightening and China may feel emboldened to take over Tawaiin.
Some poverty and homelessness. Some big cities where inflation has been too high and there are no jobs cities. I am familiar with cities like Seattle and Baltimore. Decent people with jobs that have lost them and cannot find anything to support their families. Even in smaller cities you are seeing more people living on the streets.
economy/TM/value of our U.S dollar
currently the treasury giving access to people's information the Elon Musk
Id say the biggest problem is peoples personal righta autonomy over their own bodies 
consensus to get rid of democracry
Unabated immigration invasion because criminals are getting in and we have too many people here already, and they're letting people come in that we have to pay for. 
I would say discrimination on all levels. I guess since 2016 I guess just since you know it seems like if the mndset is if someone doesnt look like you talk like you believe like you then youre just onna write them off. 
I think the constant division and we're not getting anything resolved. /AE/ I don't see it getting better. I see it getting worse for average Americans. /AE/ No, I don't want you to have to stay all day.
Inflation, its just been to high for average working person to keep up with or even proffesional have a [REDACTED FAMILY MEMBER] that is a nurse had to take a second job to make ends meet
IMMAGRATION- ITS UNCONTROLLED
 Immagration  there need to be more control
We have a problem with our national deficit
Wealth disparity
I can't tell you.
Too much free money from covid and now everyone whats a lot of wages and people cant afford groceries and stay out of other peoples country business
The economy/probe/Prices are really high because of inflation. Businesses want to purchase up homes so they can rent then or sell them for higher. Groceries are higher so it is not as affordable to buy them. Being able to purchase a home is getting harder as well
racism the rich  should pay there portion and wealth should be shared 
economy- its bad everything everything is too high gas food and cost of living
I guess our economy would be one /tm/ just seems like everythings high and nobody's got enough income to live in it 
I guess the economy. I think we still havent fully recovered from post pandemic inflation and big buisnesses can price gouge a lot of people so things become more expensive. 
Unemployment/P/Not enough jobs for qualified people./AE/ No that's it
money driving decisions- just think politicians working w/big biz to make decisions and focus on problems based on money
Homeless americans, uh there should be no such thing as  a homeless americans, I feel like if we have money to help people in other countries we should have money to help our own citizens, that's the problem, especially veterans there should be no such thing as a homeless vet /AE/ No
I would say, no unity. The country has no togetherness, everyone's kind of against against eachother.
Overthrow of our democracy. The Constitution states; Anyone who commits an insurection is not eligible to hold public office. Donald Trump should not be allowed to hold office.""
The threats to democracy what our incoming chief executive might do to democracy
immigration, too many people crossing the border illegal
Immigration. /problem/ Lack of accountability.
Illegal immigration. Primary one is that we are losing our identity as a nation. because they're not assimilating. Causing additional crime, and causing a drag on our social safety net system. 
the border. they need to close that border down
Immigration
Violent Racist Extremism. I think that white nationalism has been allowed to take a back seat in the political consciousness in the last few years since the Biden administration took office, allowing a misunderstanding of the threat it represents in our country and presumption that it has been largely solved or relegated to a lesser risk. /AE/ No.
Where do I start uh, the education for, education now the school system now is terrible to me. 
immigration/tm/just the way it should be handled it seems like two different parties want to do two differnet things with it
Partizanship; neither side will work with theother side
Economy. /Probe/ Look at the money! Trying to live. /AE/ Well, it really affects everything, if a person's having a hard time pulling off life, they're going to reach out to bad things, if they can't do it this way can't have a job... It's like a circle, like a wheel on a bicycle. If it affects one thing, it affects the second wheel of the spoke. /AE/ Suffer everybody. And I really feel the companies know that they can push the card you know? Pushing pushing, they put it here and know they can keep pushing them. How do I put it, people are up at the top right? They don't really care about the people that are going to the bottom, it's only 'how much money can I get out of this'. I think people have lost humanity, you know? They don't care about anybody else, wether you have money or not. It's just awful out there. /AE/ Again I just feel like that humanity inside, this is probably off the beaten path. I went out to dinner the other night, and theres this gentleman in his 50's, large structure okay. But he's walking in with two metals canes cause he can hardly walk, if I guessed he probably had a stroke or somehting. I wanted to get up and help him, and I was, but my boyfriend said to wait, but I gotta help to do a little. I just watched how he was determined and how he struggled 10 feet to get to a chair, and how determnined he was. And just as I was about to get up, a guy beside him helped him to get a chair. He impressed me so much, there was another couple that came with him. i said should I or shouldn't I, I said I'm gonna. I stopped and talked to him and told him how much of an example he was. He was determined, he didn't ask for anyone to help him, but that there were two people who came and helped him. You wanna hear the clincher? As i walked away, he started talking to me, and he said I have to tell you, I'm like this because of COVID. How do you like that? You know, sad? Sad sad, you know. But again I reached out and hold him that I acknowledged him, you know? /AE/ Trump better do something right away, as fast as he can. cause he's tied too right? /AE/ Nope.
We have a president that's coming into presidency that is a crook, that who is the lowest common denominator unfortunetly 
the cost of living. /tell/ far too high. /ao/ Everything: groceries, housing , all too high, especially in our state of MA. 
the ability to govern highly complex issues, both local and international in a divided democracy and govern effectivily
immigration /tell/ I feel that too many people have been allowed in without the proper ...without following the proper steps.
Inflamation. It's way too high right now.
Freedom. I feel like we're losing it because of the election. I feel that with the election we've chosen a president that will taking some freedoms away. 
it's global warning, our resourses and what they apply to other creators of this world.  Such a animals, birds all the creators of this word. They are here as equals and she be protected aswell as man kind
Trump. He's a criminal, he lies, he's not as smart as he wants people to think he is, he reminds me of a mob boss. He had a bad relationship with the press, he's sneaky, and he cheats on his wife. 
immigration /tm/ i feel like our borders got lax after Trump was no longer in office 
Disunification /probe/that our country is seemingly irrelibly spliteach side is demonizing the other side so there is no hope to getting back together
body autonomy of women freedom of choice of medical care
Refusal
our president wants to be an autocrat, and his party is goin along with him, and I dont likeit
The economy/tm/it shifted to...it favors the haves. It is unbalanced.
Gun violence for sure. Maybe school shootings.
I think there's a big divide between the upper 1% having a pulse on the rest of the country. I feel like a lot are out for themselves and their businesses, and not so much for the greater good of everyone. 
Sticking our nose into other country's affairs
the illegal immagration- way too many people that have beren giving tax payer money and support
abortion /wp?/ the effect that it needs to be regulated and not left up to the woman to decide: too many rules
economics
Abortion /probe/ i believe it hsould be in the rights of the women so i am pro choice. I believe women should have the choice over their body not the state or government 
Well I'm pausing now because I'm trying to decide which of the multitude of problems we have now which one is number 1 on my list. I think it would have to be the open border. Because, if that were fixed it would stem a lot of the other problems we have right now. Including the economy. Help the economy, cutting down on crime. /AE/ No i think that's good. I think that's a good place to start.  A lot of other things will fall in line once that is done.  It's like setting up a line of dominoes, you tip the first one and it runs the gamete of everything else. /AE/ No
illegal immigration /P/ too many illegals entering the country /P/ many are criminals committing crimes /P/ well the biggest problem it is against the law to be here illegally /P/ uh proviind for them costing much money /P/ um no
Diversion / TM / everybody is looking out for themselves instead of everyone as a whole
Homelessness. No one has money to afford a place to live, so they're sleeping in cars, tents, parks, anywhere they can sleep and lay their head. People don't have jobs, don't have money, so people kill, rob, steel, whatever they can. /ae/That's homelessness, yeah.
High cost of living
wages are not going up, but prices of all of our goods are going up and Americans can not afford it.
Money problem; They say they dont have money but they always iv e money tp phter countries. I nstead of hlping the poeple here they help somewhere else. Like no they finna take social security and everything from old people. Theyfinna start a war around here. They doing very poor for us cirixzens on the money tip.
division in this country /tm/ people dont listen to each other
Economics/P/ would say the lack of support for working class people as well as inflation./AE/No
the upcoming President / TM / His policies
Morals. I dont believe people take responsibility for themselves/Ao/ I see a disillusion of the family in america/Ao/ No
division thats the outcome of multiple problems
racism, he highten across the board
The economy. Inflation, lack of money of the money class.
Homelessness, that there is a lot of homelessness and they are not really doing anything to help the homeless. A lot of them need health care and a place and I feel like they are not even putting the shelters out there for them.  /AE/ NO
No unity because we are  one nation and we are suppose to be  united states under god and that is not displaced across the board. We are multi cultural and that is not respected across the board
Refusal
Inflation /pr/the cost of living has gone up too fast and my pay has not gone up even close to match it
One problem facing this country is divisiveness, the division in the country /probe/ some people they like they a lot of people want to be want people like Trump to rule things and I think he's not a good person to be over everybody, I don't think he is good for the country and so many people do, over half /AE/ that's it
our economy/tm/the government out spends it budget. i have to stay on one. you have to stay on one. they should stay on one/ae/no
Climate. Climates are going to change, and humans are not doing what we can to mitigate that change. 
Immigration. /ms/ Illegal immigrants, the open borders; just the fact that taxpayer-funded money goes to people who don't belong here anyway or came here illegally.
national debt; its staggering large
Healthcare/tm/The cost and who has access to healthcare
I think the growing polarization between people 
Discord. It is discordant. 
rightward polarization/tm/i think that donald trump has pushed the conservative movement further to the right on many issues; and i think that the democrats have not presented a positive vision for the country and are instead debating the issues on the right's terms
para mi el peor probema es tanto abuso de gente que matan; mucho probmas de hacer problemnas; deber ver un castigo; no es justo
Polarization, That social media and methods of communication have further separated the population in such a way that news, facts, streams of inofrmation are different among the people resulting in political extremism, the spread of misinformation and for people to again be separtaed by their ideologies or by their perceived ideologies /AE/ No
Inequity in inclusiveness. /ms/ There has been a huge shift in perception of LBGQ including transgender in society in general, and that has impacted the way our lawmakers are making decisions.
The white house candidates like our candidates with helping poor people like me. I fell like weneed a stronger PResident. I feel like we need a stronger president to lead our amrican citizens

econmoy -prices are too high
Economy  and inflation and the national debt which effect the economy
Unity. People are too tribal now days because of what they think politically.
the big problem is inequality rich people getting richer and poor getting poorer
Health benefits, Everybody should have them no matter what. Rich, poor or inbetween./AO/ I think everybody deserves them it. Doesn't matter if your rich or poor, middle class or in between. Everybody should have them. Whie black yellow whatever everbody and it should be equal. Not outragious prices that people cant afford. The rich can get them easily but not the poor same as the middle class./AO/ Because how people are being paid to work some people get $10 and hour and other get paid $20 an hour doing the same job. It should be equal pay so people can afford them same as if your a woman or a guy./AO/Pay wages suck and I dont agree with the government when they say other people can get them but we have to pay our butts off./AO/ No, I think everybody else should have them basically and it should be equal across the board./AO/ No
taxes; i dont think we should have to pay the; taxes on tips
i'm going to say racism/tm/people being equal, division among races. they should not spread hate they should all be equal because natives they are here first this is their land. the rest of us are all immigrants however, no racism should exists. also more importantly latin communities should not be considered as foreigners, i can't stant when they say go back to mexico or any other latin country/ae/that's it
ah the divide /P / I don't understand why we cant just come together and figure everything out /P/ no
Healthcare /p/ too expensive, and health insurance companies are a legal scam. 
financial debt, everyting costs too much and we don't make enough as people, the common man /AE/ other countries provide for their people that are in debt and our country does not at all, we have to fight for every penny we get for sure /AE/ child support sucks, should be redefined /AE/ housing shouldn't take so long, section 8 /AE/ low house income should be better, shouldn't have to jump through so many hoops /AE/ loans, financial debt, once you get into a loan you can't get out of a loan, creditors, title loans or car loans, those are all a fraud, once you get itno that you can't get out of it, because of the principal that doesn't make sense, I only borrowed $2000 /AE/ plain and simple the laws don't match the times we live in /AE/ No
high tax rate-its unfair how they are charging and the wearthy are not paying enough
So far I've heard I think the biggest problem is illegal immigrants coming into America. No thoughts I try to stay neutral. 
spending money everywhere and problems with social security and disabilty and stuff like that and spending money everywhere else
I think that the working peope cannot get ahead It seems like when we get a raise, property taxes go up, health insureance goes up, and cost of living goes up. Wehn we never feel like we make any money. My percentage wage increase is less than what my taxes go up. If I get a 3% raise, my property taxes go up 9 or 11%. As an example, that was.
the chaos of Donald Trump
inequality /tm/ there are great disparities between racial, gender and social class
rACISIM ALOT OF RACIST

Xenophobia, My understanding of Xenophobia is when someone is threatened or made uncomfortable by someone who is different than them and then villanizes them.  /AE/ No
homelessness, the prices of rent has skyrocket that the average american can not survive
The lgbqt movement /tm/ it goes against biblical teaching it is kind of thrust upon children you see it children shows and movies it is kind of everywhere /ae/ I dont have anything against gay lesbian transgender I just dont think sexuality should be talked about with children
Unchecked immigration/tm/First of all, it's an affront to all the people who came here and waited in line. it's a drain on resources. And it's a known fact that several thousand people that have come across the border in recent years are convicted felons in other countries
The economy. The over all cost of goods and supplies and the housing
The primary problem facing ous country is misinfomation.

Inflation; everything is going up. Young people can hardly afford to live on wht theyre making. Thats if they have a family. 
There are so many problems but the one that affects me the most is national defenese, it is not what it needs to be /AE/ There's not enough money to provide for national defense and when the money is allocated for national defense it's usually put in places where it is not needed /AE/ No, I'll leave it at that and then he continued... It has to do with the practices and morals of the people the government is trying push forth, if you can't trust the individual that's with you in the foxhole, then you won't be protected, in terms of morality you have destroyed the cohesiveness of the fighting force, that priamrily has to do with homosexuals in uniform, if they are in an office and in regular clothes it doesn't matter but in combat it does /AE/ No I'm not going to add 
Immigration, there's too many illegals over here /AE/ the crime that's come up because of it /AE/ No that should do it
problem with corruption in government lead to all the other problems coruption in government
inflation-just the rise of cost of goods, gas and property
I would say civil rights.
Immigration; all the illegal immigrants crossing the border; you need two things to have a country a border and law and order and now we have neither; I don't have a problem with anyone coming in legally. /ae/no
right now major problem in this country is unfortuntely the illegals is a major problem to omany people have died from criminials crossing the boarder who have records
The next administration is coming in, I dont think the next administration is going to have any checks or balance so I think they may run it differently then it has been in the last 250 yrs
womens rights/po/access to health care
Economy, prices are bad.
Lack of, the lack of understanding of information thats out there, so much disinformation, not enough education on how to properly interpet information and discern if its legit or propaganda

violations of the 2nd amendment/tm/ red flag laws missing due Process. the gun control act of 1939. NFA of 1986 are all unconstitutional and need to be taken of the record of legality.

Sterotyping, putting people in boxes, it's not a black & white world, no B&W answers.
Global security, the number of countries wiling to engage in war at this time

international affairs
The division in citizens in relation to the future of the country. /p/ Its just that people blindly following leaders and others that are actually doing the research to know what the problem and outcome is going to look like.
the biggest problem would be border security /WP/ I dont think the government has a han dle on it the government thaats there right now  Selling parts of the border wall for pennies on the dollar before the new administration comes in the money means nothing why would you sell it other than spite /ae/no
Racial tension
the economy /tell/ The prices of everything and everybody struggling to make ends meet as far as the house prices, the groceries, the gas
I think the problem is that congress and those in charge did not take care of things tht needed to be done with people that needed to be done before now. They said it was all done and it wasnt. They picked their part over right and wrong and wouldnt impeach somebody and the problem just got bigger and bigger in my opinion./ao/ wel it still goes on you know/ao/
unity- become so divisive. always fighting. no compromise
i think one problem now is the price of everything going up. I've noticed that the dollar doesn't stretch as far as it used to because everything is getting more expensive. So that's one problem. /AE/ No
One of the most important at the time is the price of food and gas, economics I guess, the economy

war they're spending a lot of money on the war /AE/ the main problem is they are spending the money to the war in another country the previous government has spend too much money in the war so they are not giving money to benefit the usa people, now the prices high and government is not giving sufficient benefit to the people /AE/ This is pretty much done
Immigration. /ms/ The lack of immigration control.
The election of trump. He is um not a very good person and his plans for the presidency are selfish and he's going to nominate a number of people who i disagree with strongly and policies i disagree with strongly. 
That we think that the citizen actually matters. it's a shell game.
the economy /probe/ a narrowing of the middle class and a conglmeration of wealth to the top /ae/ the lower class' purchesing power, housing prices /ae/ unchecked corporate power/ae thats it
Democracy, I think we risk losing our democracy as we know it in having a few people controlling the government as opposed to how it has been designed by the founding fathers /AE/ Well that's a big one, no, that's it
So the main problem that I have with the american industry is the availability of abortions or womens right to choose over their own bodies. I dont think it's right there's so much an intensive law over women or their bodies. If they're conceived out of a dangerous office they have to have that choice. With Trump in office and implementing laws against abortion, it feels that women won't have the safe aortion option like they should. They won't have control over their bodies. Just to elaborate on that it kind of feels like women don't have control over their bodies. Especially with them kind of pushing back against roe v wade and stuff like that. That's very very scary against women who know what they want to do with their bodies and if they need an abortion they cannot get a safe and lean one for lack of a better term. /AE/ nope.
This country should feed their poor, take care of their poor people instead of worrying about everybody else.
Are politicans are in the pockets of lobbists and special interests, not doing the people's will but doing their own will or what they are paid to do.
The devisiveness in this country, the polarization, the lack of concern about the future. 
Division, is big, uh I think its the biggest, I dont know what else /probe/ I think, I do think that there is, people have just become far too radical, come back to center, or at the very least learn to get along
Border Security is number one. Illegals coming in. if they come through the front door, I don't care. Do it legally. /AE/ I think it should be secure to stop fentanol from coming in. Human trafficing. /AE/ Basically that's it. I think there's a few people coming in that shouldn't be here, terrorists. Keeping terrorists out too. /AE/ No
the economy, I don't believe there is many jobs being reported and people are looking for jobs and not being able to find them and with prices going up that's a concern 
immigration law /tell/ I think that there isn't a clear path to immigrants becoming productive citizens.
I think the prices of housing , not everyone has the opportunities to afford housing some make more money than others. 
The definition of abortion affecting women's safety /tell/ That women who need DNC after a miscarriage are having trouble getting that because physicians are not wanting to perform that procedure. 
the main problem is our slide into facisim and autocracy in to a dictctator
Inflation and the cost of living is the number one thing I think right now for Americans. /AE/ I think everybody right now is struggling to be able to afford putting groceries on the table, filling our cars with gas. Us personally owning a small business it has affected us a lot. /AE/ No
the economy; its not enough jobs and enough pay with the jobs
one of them would probaby be the homeless issue; there have been so many, as the years go by there have been more and more
Wealth inequality. Tax cuts for the rich have essentially gouged the working and lower class, so even though the pie may be getting bigger the slice isn't growing enough. As a result issues like food insecurity, lack of healthcare and education still exist in the richest nation in the world. /AE/ No.
Capitalism. There's no regulations and so I feel like because of that there's no room for small business. /AE/ It doesn't allow for equality. /AE/ We'll leave it at that.
security- dont feel is as strong as we used to be to step up and protect our citizens
HUNGER- CHIDREN BEING HUNGRY
The lack of ability to get together and listen to each other
I'll just sum it up with Donald Trump /tm/ tendancy to megalomania, cronism, self grandizement at the expense of the public good
I guess in just in nut shell the trump presidency is the problem facing this country, /tm/ yeah, the problem is that theres this is culmination of the trump presidency is culmination of big business people like elon musk, people looking to have their interest in power over people with combination with that its the culmination of evanjulical movement to you know you know harnested, those two interest have combined forcces to infringe, not infrige but shut down peoples rioghts, ecmaple, friend rushing to get married, lesbinans concerned if they dont get married before 2025 in jeopardy it wont happen, feels like in prespist of a lot of peoples rights being taken away, it is sad people who have been suffering financially and other way have been duped that trump presidency and far right movement will help them and make thier lives better I think it will do the opposite 
the border

cost of;iving/tm/housing costs and scarcity/tm/just um the number of homes being built has not kept up[ with Population growth and the needs. and that has led to a small supply and increased demand
the division between people the need for more communition and participating in groups to discuss problems that inolve people
Downfall of Democracy. /ms/ With us and globally. Cause the world's falling apart.
the economy; things are just out of control; the prices are out of control; for a senior citizen on a fixed income is so difficult; on my gas bill they have these fees and winter charges, and its amounting to more; their delivery charges are higher thatn the usage; and we have a monopoly of water, gas and electric; its killing us seniors; 
id say the economy /tm/ I feel that its unstable that we really dont know whats going to happen in the near futre or even in the extended future 
The economy is very bad, the first important thing 
regulatory capture- i think there is outside interestes of capilalist money and interest of all mones
I would say disinformation I think just about everything else branches out from that, social media, bots and disinformation.
I am terrified of Russia of what they may do... especially now that Trump is in office.""
Immagration coverage has been negative and there there is no framework for people who are already here to become legal. 
Immigration. /ms/ I think lack of process in having people come into this country.
the massive division b/w people
lack of sense of responsibility, peoiple would rather other peple work and they take fruit of their labe rather than building their own life would rather take from someone who has already established their life
I'm disturbed by the rural/urban divide. I feel it in the county and in the nation/tm/I think part of it is education level but i know some very well educated farmers and ranchers. i think it has to do with culture and different kinds of exposure to trans and homosexual people.
Immigration and border security. /ms/ There is an abundance of illegal immigration that needs to be stopped.
I would say based on this election it's misinformation, especially when people don't know who they're voting for. I mean it can lead to other issues. There's a lot of fear going on right now, people don't know who they're voting for. The way reality is now, you don't know how it seems, there are votes being cast for trump from people who are voting for him because for instance they don't think the economy is doing well, however it is, you don't know anymore. Everyone is living in a bubble, for instance the way I use social media I thought harris would win by a landslide, but it was a reality check for me, of hey, we're all in our own little bubbles. 
Inflation. 
 Womens reproductive rights  securing better healthcare options for pregnacy before,during and after 
Probably the economy /tm/ well it's overspending by our government /ao/ no
not coming to agreement, a lot of argument, very one-sided
immigration - they need to close the border - secure it more
Disinformation, disinformation is when it's intentional (misinformation is when it's not intentional); I don't know if I can briefly tell you; I do whole lessons on it in school; the majority of residents of the US do not understand or have enough information to make good decisions - social, cultural or political or medical.
President Trump. He is not educated to be president and he doesn't know the constitution or respect the constitution.
Our democracy. This country has elected a man that wants to do away with our democracy. He wants to be a king.
La economia que sube.
Open Boarders. There letting in everybody and anybody. Which is a lot of criminals, gangs, rapist, murders. You can look on the news and see it. A lot of people are being raped and murdered. They need to come in the front door and not the back. Its raised the level of our crime rates here in the US. A lot them dont have jobs or places to live also I noticed that several schools have pushed the kids out and their turning it into places where illegal immigrants have a place to live and it has totally increased our crime rates bad. /AO/ A lot of drugs are coming across the boarder still. A lot of bad drugs serious stuff. /AO/ Just that Im all for the immigrants coming in legal through the front door. It make take a little time but legally. /AO/ I think thats probably enough

racisim/tm/there is racists that feel superior from others when it shouldn't be/ae/no
more pay /probe/ well not enough pay. 
Abortion
Immigration. It's not about who's coming here. It is more about the drugs that are coming across the board. It's not necessarily the people coming across the border but how Congress is handling it. 
I think climate change is one.
student debt- too many kids going to college and graduating with it
The economy/tm/prices
No money for the middle class an the poor. Financing I guess you can call it. We're trying to live on a low income on high dollar products. We've gotta get these things down to where they're more affordable. How I dont really know, but theres got to be a way. 
inflation-out of control our  wages are not keeping up with the rising costs i should not be budgeting with food to make sure my kids have shoes. every expense is crimpling
The loss of respepct for human  life /TM/ whe i look at the news you see people are killed for no reason/TM/ people aren't disaplined and it starts with when they are a child /TM/ Many lack Chrsistian values which is also condusive to their behavior
The economy. Jobs.  /AE/ Yes, there's so much. Housing for the homeless. Food that people can't afford. We have a very poor economy.  It's like no one cares about the poor and middle class. They only care about ...If you're rich you have everything and you're on top. That is where this country lies.  It should be fair. If you are out here working hard trying to make a living you should be treated just like everyone else. /AE/ Just fairness just that it needs to be fair all the way around. All people should be treated the same there should be no difference. It should be that people can afford housing and food... the top 1 or 2 percent have billions while everyone else suffers. /AE/ no
I think the people is division, that people are divided, on the national levelof the government, that is the major problem
Donald Trump as President.
Donald Trump, MAGA, climate change, gun control, wars. That's enough for now.
Immigration /tm/ too many illegals /ao/ no

Economy. Well most people belive the economy is bad so they do a poor job in explaining the economy. They sit and watch fox new and they tell them its bad. I ean its not perfect but its not that bad. So I would suppose its the information surronding the economy/AO/ Because people don't trust it they think that its not doing well. So when there is no aith they act differently. pay 1,300 for taylor swift ticket but complain about a dozen eggs/AO/ No

income inequality /tm/ the disparity between the wealth of the upper class and the lower class
Cost of living/tm/I think that prices of everyday good from groceries to housing have skyrocketed in the past few years and wages haven't kept up with that, in general.
That they are looking at the people of color to disregard to make the they color to make it in life and not understand that everyone have to eat or live like everybody else. Don't choose one color over the other. Because one color do not make this world function, because it don't. /AE/ Favoritism is not the answer.  We all have to live in, lets say, not world, the same neighborhood. /AE/ We all want to get paid the same and we always want to eat the same and we always want to pay our bills the same.  It's so stupid to divide people when we all want to live the same.  /AE/ No
Job shortage /probe/ not enough jobs, underpaid, understaffed /AE/
I think things are to expensive the cost of everything is to high
There's so many. I think our biggest probem right now is our new president coming in. I think that's the biggest one with all the issues like that. /AE/ About him coming in? It's just he, I just don't trust him. i don't believe anything, i never thought I'd live long enough to see a felon become president, and I'm just disgusted by it frankly. i mean it scares me what's gonna happen, and I've never felt like that. i mean there's been presidents I've never voted for because I didn't like certain things, bt I've never felt afraid or anything like that. No, there's been democrat or republican theres been changes, but this guy, he's crazy.
Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. /what is the problem/ He is a complete con man and I feel he will take our nation into dangerous territory.

Um, um I guess, hmm. What could it be... Okay, inflation.  /probe/ Oh, what is the problem. Just everything is sky high in prices I guess, gas and food and rents and houses and. /AE/ No.
The economy / TM/ Prices are too high, no one can afford anything, I think Immigration needs to be worked on and the government needs to work together instead of working apart

I think there are multiple problems this country is faced with now, racism, sexism homophobics, bigots.. I'll focus on sexism. I think the devide between men and woman is increasingly going every day and I think it is creating a inbalance where womans rights are in danger of being taken away with every new law or idea that is set in to motion. /AE/ No

I don't think you can have political discourse with anybody, friends family, work mates, yeah I'm thinking that's the end of the statement I think.
probably the economy /tm/ well prices are still a little higher than most people are comfortable wtih and the economy is not exactly even and fair in all areas, housing still very high in a lot of areas and childcare, transportation, things that impact people
Immigration /TM/The fact that we have open boarders and coming across and not going through the legal process and entry points and not registering. that is why just coming across the Rio. Just not one, coming across in varration directions which is adding to crime. There is no vetting process just coming across in droves.

individual people still trying to recover from recent economic turbulance
The most important problem facing our country right now is division, amongst ourselves. Also out militry is no good no more, and we're not keepung p our strength and we could be overtaken technologically, they could do it in one step.
We are very divided, there's a lot of misinformation, I don't think people understand the news sources they trust and that informs their decisions.
The biggest issues, the economy.  The price of everything has gone up exponentially under Joe Biden. And, the focus, the economy, under Joe Biden has been less on the economy and more on other issues that are less important. The bills and policies that Joe Biden and the democratic party have proscribed for the economy, I feel, are weakiening the economy instead of strengthing it. And inflation has gone up so much under his watch, Joe Biden's watch. Additionally the Democratic party likes to spend money on things that hurt the economy. All in All we need the price of everyday goods to go down, we need to bring jobs back to the United States, we need less taxes and a smaller government.  And, we should cut government spending where it is not needed. Additionally we need lower rent costs and housing costs. And, part of it is bringing more jobs here and cutting unnessary spending. I personally never felt a difference except under Joe Biden in terms of the economy.  Everything was super expensive initially and that was more than a reactionary event beccause of Donald Trump's presidency. Because under Donald Trump I was making more money than I ever have and under Obama I wasn't making as much but still the economy under Joe Biden was crazy. Crazy bad. So I think the cost of goods is the number one concern of most Americans and I think the government needs to do some things about that.  /AO/ no
Um, Probably violence /wt/ Uh, I just think theres a lot of gun violence, towards people 
economic issues/tm/that big busuiness are primarly in control so it creates a further divide between classes
I would say probably haveing decent paying jobs in the future. Having a job being able to deal with the everyday growing market. I'm jobs are lacking in pay, smaller can't afford their own place. People are renting out rooms, and people aren't having houses like in the past. That's become a common thing The everyday working american is not being able to afford housing and food even though their going to work everyday and paying taxes everyday. I feel like the day that you graduated school, where you had a. Hopefully we are able to keep up with the growing expenses
uh, economy / I think the economy can be better as far as prices for groceries, prices for fuel, it could be beter /AE/ it's just making it hard for people to buy homes, rent homes, groceries, basiclly it makes it hard on people, especially people who are retired like myself and it makes it hard when social security doesn't go up as much as inflation does and we got it hard / AE/ prices, basicilly / AE/ no

I know children who have had this experience and gotten so confused, almost suicidal, because they were so confused about having to choose what they are. We have gone overboard with all these sexual options. These are young children--what the heck. And they don't advise parents either.

THe education system is flawed. Now their trying to push the New age stuff on the kids. their curriculum is based off of a IPads, where they can just upload a subject or a you know, a topic on their computer they can teach the kids. There doesn't seem to a lot vetting or studying of the teachers, theat their learning the subject before they're pushing it on the kids. The teacher unions are kind of skewed up from what i've learned. 
Biden, he's a crook/ae/no he's been in policits a long time. I got a website I go to that covers this stuf.. The site X, formerly Twitter. 
Contention, I think it was so bad that one candidate undid everything the previous candidate did, even that which was good. I mean when you start undoing what was good to oppose the other candidate that's not good and that is bringing us to a place that is not good.  And then they have people who have unhealthy lifestyles that support them, like transgender in sports and using public restrooms and people that give money to them instead of using common sense. /AO/ Well I think that we've seen that the people that are supporting certain candidates have so much power and pursuasion that when they have rioting in the streets they don't take action to stop it because they don't want to offend their contributors. /AO/ No

Racism.Its about to get worse with the president. It got worse when he was first elected and it will get worse because white people feel like they can do whatever they want to do to us. /AO/ The president elect has shown favoritism towards racist groups. That scares me. /Ao/ No

Immigratoin kinda of big right now so I will go with that one /probe/just a  lot of illegal immigrants sneak in and get jobs and get some of them in some places even get more like hands out and what not then normal residents in some areas.

Our inability to compromise, based on what we hear in the news media and what I hear from other people there is no middle ground. Everyone feels their position is the correct position and there is no room for compromise. AE Well, I think the loudest voices seem to get the most attention and that is part of the problem AE I seem to notice that if I go to one of the major networks FOX or MSNBC it is vilification of the pary that is not supported by that channel and there is no room for compromise AE

Refusal
I don't know. 
war; i would say um as far as deciding who wer're gonna nad help how; and if we're going to ontervene, and if itsproper to intervene or not; 
I guess the disparity in income of the very well-to-do and those that live paycheck to paycheck. It's just so difficult for them to save for retirement. And those who make a lot of money, it's easier to make more money. If you don't have much money it's hard to get to get a leg up.

You don't have money to get what you want and there's no way to get money because who wants to hire a 90 year old lady /AE/ No, that'll do fine, it was supposed to be brief anyway
Unity. /ms/ People need to get their act together and have respect for each other. It's not business what religion you are, what geneder you are. As long as we treat each other with respectme nice.
from a social basis ther si amssive shift toward rgt wing culture, there is a swath of misinformation thia is becoming th social consessus
The economy in general. The fact that I'm still making the same amount of money I was 5 years ago and prices have gone up. The price of living has gotten higher and the pay isn't changing.
