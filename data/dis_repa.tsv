V240001	V241176 - PRE: What does R dislike about the Republican party [text]
140003	Everything on their agenda is repellent to me. Their disregard for a woman's right to privacy and to govern her own body is abhorrent. [CHAR(10)]Their desire to keep lowering taxes and protect the wealthy instead of forcing the riches among us to pay their fair share is irresponsible and immoral.[CHAR(10)]
140005	rhinos, taxes,
140006	They are cult followers who care about one man rather than the country. they are all weak and a disgrace like scared rabbits
140012	they are all about money, and making sure the rich get richer
140013	i dont know i dont care about politics and fake news
140014	Everything as it has become the Trump party lacking a conscious.
140017	their positions on women's healthcare, election fraud claims, plans to strip social security, as well as remove EPA, dept of education.
140018	greed, cater to the rich, single-minded view of who is a real American
140019	Way too ideological.
140023	Backwards/unproductive stances and policies for crime, prisons, schools, retirement, environmental regulations, taxation, abortion and reproductive rights, an independent and unbiased judiciary, erosion of long-standing norms for nomination of Supreme Court justices, xenophobic rhetoric, advocacy on behalf of hostile foreign governments, advocacy on behalf of hostile domestic institutions and corporations, and almost everything else except Ukraine aid, and even then it's lukewarm.
140026	They have abandoned truth and honesty in favor of a cult following
140029	Total loss of a conservative identity with a cult of Trump
140032	The existence of a political party in any form supposes they are somehow important. The government should not exist at all outside of a very narrow band of duties and should not appear or be held up as an authority worthy of a human beings attention or resources.
140033	the Republican party has become more extreme with their agenda proposing anti LGBTQ laws and book bans, the GOP is anti-science, too restrictive of woman's rights, white nationalism and infusion of religious doctrine is entering into government, the GOP is becoming too isolationist by waning support of Ukraine and NATO, and they are in complete denial of human caused climate change
140034	they do a poor job getting out the vote
140035	way too many right wing extremists
140037	THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE LEAST OF PEOPLE'S NEEDS IN THIS SOCIETY
140038	Traditional values" aka transphobia, homophobia, misogyny. Belief in deregulation of the market. Cutting taxes for billionaires. Anti-abortion. Locally in Ohio, very interested in consolidating power by any means necessary incl. gerrymandering districts. "

140043	spend too much money
140044	Their stance on anti abortions
140048	morally bankrupt, follow crazy politicians
140050	They refuse to compromise on any issue when they don't get their way. That's not how politics works. They act like a bunch of spoiled brats who will throw a temper tantrum to show how mad they are.
140052	They seem to have abandoned all morality and ideals in order to support a man, Trump, and not the rule of law or the constitution. Also, they seem to have become believers in ridiculous conspiracy theories.
140053	not happy with anything
140055	They let Trump be their candidate when they have people like Mike Pence that they could have nominated. There are other republican candidates that would have also been good candidates.
140056	SK
140060	their general lack of caring. it’s all about religion and their point of view
140061	their ambition stance, their opposition to health care, their attempt to overturn the élections, their policy on immigration
140062	I do not like the way they vote on most hot button issues/legislation. They also seem to care only about themselves and their wealthy friends.
140063	Abortion Restrictions
140065	they say their for the conservative lifestyle but have cowardly backed trump.
140066	It represents the interests of rich, white men. It's policies are racist and anti-woman.
140067	Many seem more interested in power than governing. Threats to democracy like Jan 6. Policies that hasten climate change instead of slowing it down. Keeping us from having a public health care system like our global peers.
140070	Rude and all for the rich people.
140072	they go along with what trump tells them example the border bill he told them not to approve
140076	 I dislike Donald Trump and the new MAGA Republican Party, the old GOP was just the other team""
140077	I don't like politicians but someone has to do it.
140079	project 2025 plan to destroy democracy
140081	disrespectful arrogant behavior
140082	They pander to people who vote against their own interests
140083	They are all too old or too immature to actually focus on the things that matter most to Americans. They try to hide their agenda in bills before voting to pass them or they block them altogether. They are not using their platform for America and are too busy protecting their ego or fighting amongst themselves. They are blinded by Donald Trump and ignoring the extremely unethical Supreme Court! Most of them make money on the stock market due to insider, confidential information or line their pockets with lobby money.
140086	They're regression.

140105	neither of them can work together to the good of the people
140107	They generally don't stand up for what they say they believe in. When it comes to taking a true stand or going along with the Democrats on spending, they cave and go along with a compromise that overly favors the Democrats spending.
140108	SEVERAL PEOPLE WITHIN THE PARTY
140112	They some times fight amoung there self,,
140115	They are hostile and not for the average American. Their campaigns are based on hatred of immigrants and non white Americans.
140116	They don't stick together.
140117	The fact that they are only for themselves.. This party literally wants our country to consist of rich or poor people. Lesser taxes for the rich??? Are you kidding me. Give us(Middle class) a break!

140124	Largely, they value pro life choices, tax cuts for the wealthy, hard immigration laws

140132	they are building a theocratic empire
140133	RINOs
140134	They all got in line behind Donald Trump for a power grab to the detriment of the US. Push the narrative of a rigged election, not holding accountable Trump for his part in insurrection Jan 6th, and also failing to remove him from office with 2nd impeachment.
140136	Following party lines to get re-elected.
140139	again if your rich then that’s the party for you. just my opinion.
140141	ultra conservative views that impact the safety and wellbeing of people who don’t look like them or believe in what they believe
140142	The republican party has always been about themselves and not the American people. They are helping the house pass laws on women not being able to get abortions. Hence the Roe vs Wade which was a terrible decision for women. How can a bunch of men tell a woman about her own body. We need a solution to these politicians ASAP !
140143	extremists
140144	I'm nervous/scared by the MAGA white supremacist vibes of the Republican party. Policy-wise, they seem interested in creating a society where women should only be focused on being mothers and can't have autonomy over their bodies, and where corporations should be in charge of regulating themselves. I don't want to live in their version of America.
140146	what used to be a party of principles has fallen to being a party of chaos and infighting who’s goal is to be louder and more outrageous than anyone else
140149	Failure to cut spending and control the deficit
140151	fractured not working together
140152	Unwilling to compromise or 'talk across the aisle' to come to logical agreements that benefit citizens/our country, not just their party line.

140157	survey so you will know what the world's views are
140158	Their current presidential candidate wants to establish a dictatorship, has incited a riot over last presidential results and he is still being supported by the Republican party. The Republican party seems intent on mainstreaming conspiracy theories, harboring homophobic, racist and sexist ideas, enabling wealthy Americans to get richer while punishing working class Americans in spite of talks to the contrary. The Republican party is intent on reversing hard fought gains for women and minorities.
140159	I don't know what their platform is anymore. You can't be the party of small government," then ban books, dictate what people can wear, regulate marriage, enforce religious iconography in public places, and interfere with medical treatments. They have no idea who they are, and it shows in the behavior and backgrounds of most of their representatives. "

140263	They are the Donald Trump party and they have been going along with him allowing them to create an extreme political environment
140264	I dislike the role that corporate money seems to influence the policies of any party including the Republican Party.
140268	the Republicans are NOT FREE from Corruption and seem to also work more to benefit themselves over the interest of Hard Working Americans.

140274	Some have served to long
140275	women’s rights policies, tax favoritism toward wealthy
140276	Yes, they can't seem to nominate a real candidate for president. They based their pick on what they think could win and not the best choice.
140277	The Republican party has been taken over by the Jesuits.
140279	they want to dictate and impose their conservative views on everyone no sympathy for the poor or women that may need an abortion for medical reasons also we had a boarder deal that could’ve been good for the country but they voted it down because Trump told them not to lastly some of these republican elected officials need a morality check
140280	they support Trump, big corps, against climate change
140281	they promise the moon and you only get a poster of the moon ! The Democratic and Republicans don't run the United States of America , Its Blackrock and associates . therefore I don't really care who wins .

140311	The refusal of real conservative republicans to fight against the outrageous behavior of the extremists in their midst. Whether through fear of losing their jobs or being the targets of Mr. Trump's thugs, they have stayed silent thus giving all power to MAGA. It is heart-breaking to think that they had 2 chances to rid our country of Trumpism but were more interested in self-preservation. Not very many Profiles in Courage when Trump was impeached.
140312	should be more aggressive on pursuing the Hunter Biden and Biden Crime family.

140332	they do great job in identifying all issues however never bring them to conclusion.
140334	Cultish following and support for Trump despite the fact that many of them know he is unfit and dangerous. Their focus on gaining and maintaining power for themselves and putting party over country. Elevating and protecting incompetent, dangerous people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and others. Packing the Supreme Court with dirty tricks. catering to the ultra wealthy.
140336	Crazy devotion to Donald Trump. Unwillingness to cooperate with Democrats. Stupid positions on women's health and religion.
140337	Most of them bow down to Trump and his craziness, which is hurting our country and the ability to stand up for truth and not conspiracy theories. They won't compromise and do the work they were elected to do, but just do what Trump tells them to.

140352	See my previous answer; when the Republican Party decided that only THEY know what is best for my body and my spiritual being, then they lost me entirely. if and when the powers that be in that party come to their senses (if there are any left that have an iota of personal integrity) the party may have my support again, as I said in a previous answer, I am fundamentally a conservative in my thinking.
140353	They need to all stand stronger together and fight harder
140354	It's seriously gotten off track with MAGA.
140356	Their stance on crime and homelessness have made our major cities less than desirable.

140377	Abrupt shift to extreme right, perpetuation of lies and political violence, holding the torch for Donald Trump, their hand in abortion restrictions.
140381	Republicans are corporatists. Their idea of freedom" is helping the wealthy get wealthier so there are more crumbs to trickle down to the common people. They believe in keeping people just smart enough to do a job and dumb enough do what their told unquestioningly. They thrive on ignorance and division because if the population's fighting amongst themselves they're not paying attention to the screwing they're getting from the government."
140384	the blind loyalty to Trump

140450	They always cave to the Democratic Party on issues that should have a hard line stance
140451	their partisanship and unwillingness to compromise on issues in order to govern. They are much worse then the Democrats
140452	The party has been ruined by Trumpism, and has become a destructive force in US politics. I worked on the Reagan campaign for governor of California, because of economic policy issues.

140464	Where to begin? I just believe the Republicans have lost their way and the party is nothing more than a Donald Trump cult at this point in time. I do not like their stand on gun control, reproductive rights or separation of church and state.
140465	Far right has too much influence. Every man for himself. The pie is only so big and if others get more the rest will get less attitude. Against government intervening except when it comes to women’s bodies and sexual orientation.
140467	Outright lying to constituents. Loyalty tests. I could go on but I realized back in 1992 what their game was... and it wasn't good for average Americans.

140475	Don't pull together as well as Democrats in time of need; too many factions.

140478	Not enough push back to the democrat party. Republicans do not stand together enough against the destructive leftist/socialist/marxist policies of democrats. While President Trump was in office, Republican leadership was not cohesive and united against the democrats.
140479	They tend to throw out the baby with the bathwater: we should be better stuards of our planet-- when Dems come up with ideas that would cause more harm than good in the name of saving the earth, instead of calling names: come up with your own plan to save the planet that causes less harm. [CHAR(10)]

140581	Co-opted by Trump
140585	They say that they want to give people freedom, but also want to restrict a woman's right to choose abortion, and ban books. They also say they want to go back to the way things were, which seems to mean when white people had more power and anyone who wasn't mainstream just kept quiet.

140622	The whole Republican Party has become nothing more than *yes men* for Donald Trump. They've lost all credibility
140624	Its not Ronald Reagan's party anymore. The MAGA have taken over and its there way or the highway. What happened to some compromise? Its gone. The party has become so extreme, its scary
140625	having the majority they could do more in getting answers to a lot of questionable things going on
140627	Under Trump, the Republicans increased the federal deficit a significant amount. The party is ruled by a cult of isolationists who all do the bidding of Trump. There does not seem to be an independent thinker in the group.
140631	They push back on progress unless it benefits those who look and talk like them. It is a party of hatred and showboat politics that don't actually benefit anyone but themselves.

140663	It is the party of anarchy and is anti Democratic.
140666	They've stuck behind Donald Trump for too many years. Many republicans have spoken out against Trump yet later join his side. Republicans also seem less likely to work across the aisle to resolve issues with democrats. I've also seen some very moronic/bad people hired into the republican party.
140669	old white conservative republicans who are racist
140672	I don't like the negative rhetoric.
140673	They support destroying our Constitution and have members who still say Biden did not win the election and support the January insurrection. They lean toward helping the wealthy and not the poor or middle class.
140674	As with any political party- sometimes they are out of touch or do not align with my personal beliefs. Their hardline stance on abortion is something I don't fully agree with.
140676	appear to be followers not leaders.[CHAR(10)]

140682	not talking about solutions,
140683	I think it's true with both parties they get elected & if the opposite party has control of the Congress or Senate it's hard to get what they promised passed. I know Trump is saying a lot of things, I just hope he has the full Congress behind him so he can do what he promised.
140685	At present they seem to have been brainwashed by Donald Trump and follow blindly whatever he says: example is the bipartisan immigration policy that recently was voted down because DT told the Republicans not to vote for it. Also they can't even see facts and truth before their faces but prefer to push conspiracy theories. They vote down anything proposed by Democrats.
140690	don’t agree with policies, most policies and ideals

140706	how the handle the health care system
140707	I feel they have not taken into consideration of the people in the states. I feel somewhat ramrodded over the abortion issue and not put the issues to be voted on in our states. Many of our legislators have pushed through without being on the primary ballots so doing what they want in the states without representation from the people. What happened to no religion in politics. It should be about our individual choices, and they don't cover that.
140708	Their nomination for president
140709	The Republican party is honestly the complete opposite of everything I believe in. I think they have fascist beliefs and they're trying to push us backwards. There is a lot of corruption and bigotry within that party, and I feel like it has gotten much more vocal and now their followers feel comfortable being transphobic, sexist, and racist in public.
140710	Rinos and sometimes they are just spineless
140715	financial frugality only applies to poor people. they force their religion and religious biases on everyone. they promote corporate exploitation of poor people and give advantages to the wealth holders. they demonize social systems in favor of profits
140716	To extreme on Abortion. The supreme court was correct in Roe. However, it is up to the states and the Republicans are pushing it to far right. Makes me sick.
140717	loosened restrictions on environmental policies
140718	I generally do not agree with their policies on a wide range of things, especially that of the new Republican movement in the country.

140732	Republicans want to allow the MAGA idiots & thieves to take us back to feudal times - denial of rights for women & ppl of color, immigrants (as if 99.9% of them aren't descended from immigrants,) & oppression of non-christians. We'd be like Afghanistan but with more guns, & nukes.
140734	Racism, hateful
140736	The Republicans do not do what the Democrats do and stick together.
140740	Too conservative
140742	i feel strongly that this party is becoming more of a dictatorship.
140743	Pretty much everything at this point. The are now a party of personality (Trump), rather than a political party. They change the rules to win. I used to think of Republicans as patriots, but now I realize they were only willing to talk about rule of law because they were winning in the past. Since they have begun to have trouble winning elections they are willing to change the rules to win. They cheat and undermine the integrity of our election system. I am appalled.
140745	their anti women and “other” policies
140746	Too many are supporting Trump and a vision of the country drastically misaligned to mine and what I think is right. Removing reproductive rights from women
140752	I feel there are too conservative and some of their issues are too extreme
140755	The constant pandering, the constant lies, the constant foreign aid to countries while every-day Americans are either drug addicted or too poor to pay their rent that month. The national debt. The Neo-Cons who advocate for perpetual war and advocate for the slaughtering of millions (Iraq) and regime change.
140756	high taxes/favoring the 1%
140759	all of it is narcissistic fascism and liars
140760	Their arrogance is distasteful. They are always right and unwilling to work together for the good of the country. The MEGA Republicans are atrocious. More moderate Republicans will not publicly oppose the radicals. They show their negative feelings only behind closed doors. When challenged many Republicans only work for the good of the party." They need more John McCains. "
140761	The party has gone HARD right. Very little moderation any more. They have overused trickery, Gerrymandering and have weaponized the rhertoric.

141039	crooks, will do anything for money and step on anyone to get it. lies and more lies. only think about their part, instead of the people. (common man)
141042	I’m furious with their support of Trump and their conservative policies that are pushing our country’s progress back decades.
141046	they forget to think of the little people, our vote counts too[CHAR(10)]
141047	Horrible on women's rights, the environment, the economy and have bowed to Trump
141049	it has become the party of trump- a cult and seems to be full of persons willing to do and say anything in support of trump so they can stay in power and for personal gain
141051	Because of what i just said they have a problem getting on the same page to get some important thing to be voted on
141053	Trying to control what people can and cannot do, taking away womens rights, extreme love of guns and the NRA
141055	they favor the rich over everyone, hate education, children, minorities, reproductive rights, tons of croneyism and massive corruption
141056	I don’t quite share their view on abortion. I believe it should be left up to the mother.
141057	Against abortion, takes a woman's rights to make her own decisions
141058	The Republican Party appears to be trying to take the country back in time. There are too many citizens that they don't like or care about. They seem to want to control these citizens for the benefit of themselves.
141059	unable to follow through with plans
141060	intolerance, xenophobia
141061	Divisiveness, refusal to progress, stagnancy, supporting Donald Trump for president.
141063	Everything! They have terrible policies. No one has any conviction and they all just tow the party line.
141064	MAGA, the blatant racism by some members, seems like most just kneel to Trump and that's gross. There is no honor in that.
141065	They are a political party!!!!
141068	Judging by the way things stand now with this country, I feel that they don't seem to have this country in their best interest. I feel they are trying to be Good Samaritans" without thinking what this is doing to our country. I feel that the Americans should be taken care of first and foremost before they go giving everything to others."
141071	Many are pro choice, anti feminist, deny climate change, support a lying criminal to “rule” our country, believe that Christianity is the only religion, are racist and homophobic.
141072	extremist behavior
141076	They allowed themselves to be taken over by an extreme right-wing faction of their party, which promotes racism, unfair economic policies favoring large business and wealthy supporters. Their leadership by Donald Trump has deeply divided the party. A lot of GOP leaders are now supporting Kamala Harris and not Trump, Liz Cheney and her father, for instance.
141077	Seems like they can't get out of their own way sometimes and they let Trump take over their party. But if they had a stronger party, Trump would not have come in so easily and embarrassed this country.
141078	Wishy washy feelings about abortion
141080	being anti-science. Defunding the NIH. Pulling out of the Paris climate accords. Hatred and prejudice towards those who are different. xenophobia. fear mongering about immigrants. No consideration for the truth. Letting a narcissistic sociopath endanger our democracy. Tax breaks for only the rich, which increases our deficit but they blame that on democrats. Halting legislation just to make democrats fail instead of working across the isle.
141081	They support Trump. They are self centered and very delusional individuals that only care about improving rich lives.
141082	The Republican Party has abandoned any notion of principles. I don't even know what they stand for anymore other than simply beating the Democrats. That's not a good reason to even exist, if you ask me.
141084	extremes on abortion
141085	EVERYTHING... I disagree with most of the legislation that they propose.[CHAR(10)]Throwing money away on failed policies that haven't worked in the past.
141086	no backbone--has totally become the party of Trump; failure to tax large corporations (too many corporate tax breaks); racist (characterizing all immigrants from southern border as criminals); too much Christianity appeasement (religion should stay out of politics); refuse to regulate guns; refuse to acknowledge climate change; anti-abortion, anti women's health; want to give too much power to States; hypocritical politics

141102	dont care about country(party only)
141105	Donald Trump insulting opponents and crass at times.
141106	I believe Project 2025 is horrible and it will worsen the country if Republicans are able to implement it.
141108	Their control by the gun lobby, their insistence that women shouldnt control their bodies, their demonisation of the LGBTQIA+ community, their provision of tax cuts for the rich, and their decorum. i was a republican - they sold their souls
141110	Politics are shifty.
141111	THOSE THAT DONT RALLY AROUND THEIR OWN PARTY MEMBERS.
141113	Donald Trump as leader
141117	Not love country as much as President Trump.[CHAR(10)]Coward and silent when President Trump was attacked aggressively by communist Democrats' law fare and Mar A largo raid.[CHAR(10)]Many vote with corrupt Democrats to help Biden's trillion $ for Ukraine war and too much spending policies.[CHAR(10)]
141118	when I think of the Republican party I think of Trump and I don't have good thoughts about him like I said before he seems to divide people
141120	I feel that there not here for the the struggling Americans
141122	weak and indecisive
141124	Donald Trump and the hold he has on the party. A lack of willingness to pass legislation. A horrible record on women's rights.
141129	most politicians are liars. it’s a sad truth
141131	They don't always stick together and win
141132	Seem to support big business and stock market too much. Trump needs to work on his personality.
141138	they need to grow a backbone and fight against democrats who are destroying this country with the wacky leftist agenda.
141140	that fact that they support Trump, perception that they are taking some freedoms away

141148	Donald Trump's Ass
141150	Donald Trump represents the Republican Party.
141152	MAGA extremism. No cooperation, no decorum, all divisiveness. They want to take everything for themselves and bow to their King.
141156	The constant effort to include Christian laws into US laws. Their stance on choice.
141157	Abortion and a woman's right to her having one. They are less concerned about things to the environment.
141158	The Republican Party, these days, is essentially just a wing of the MAGA movement. It is a shell of its former self, and it is full of self-serving craven politicians who are willing to sell their support to Trump in order to keep their seat. Only a handful of Republicans have shown a backbone, like Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, who have been willing to stand up for what they believe in. I sincerely hope that there are younger Republicans who can carve a path through this madness, disavowing Trump and his cronies, and forging a new way forward, rebuilding the party anew, true to the Republican principles of old.
141162	sometimes they are a little to firm on things
141164	They keep making economy hard to live in.
141165	Not forceful enough on issues.
141167	I don’t like how they’re trying to base the gov’t on religion. Separation of church and state is being erased.
141170	I don't see the number of individuals coming forward to lead this country / and make America [CHAR(10)]a world leader again; I think the Republicans in Congress the past 4-6 years aren't stepping up[CHAR(10)]to address issues plaguing our country and the World
141175	The lack of separation of Church and State and disregard for basic human rights.
141176	THE RINOS--REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY

141188	They can be a little too conservative for me.
141189	not on the same side
141191	they can still make bad choices
141192	Use religion as ways to trick constituents into supporting them. Their policies are anti-human and anti-American. They took away women’s right to healthcare be demolishing Roe V Wade. They are forcing religion into schools. They are trying to demolish our public school system. They use misinformation as facts to support their policies.
141193	The choice to allow a racist to lead their party.
141194	spending, which is a problem with both parties wasteful spending
141195	adoption of conspiracy theories into main stream thinking[CHAR(10)]restriction to abortion[CHAR(10)]control of the Supreme Court through several judges[CHAR(10)]public acceptance and sometimes encouragement of crude and unethical behavior by lawmakers

141212	many are trump over party the rest seem lost
141214	They’re not honest
141215	They have lost there way and have tied themselves to the MAGA movement , they are always looking backwards and not looking at the future needs of this country . They have not been able to free them selfs from Donald Trump . He is a loser !!!!
141216	their blind support for the traitor trump, their focus on corporations over individual rights, anti abortion focus.....
141217	Taking the Country backwards.
141222	Gun control, their take on abortion, women’s rights, policies
141226	i dont like their abortion laws and police views and their student loan policies
141228	Total embrace of Trump. Culture wars nonsense. Scrapping a bipartisan immigration bill totally because Trump wanted to campaign on immigration. Hatred and fear of anyone not heterosexual and male. The Supreme Court devolving into partisan hacks.
141229	Pro-life, ignorance of gun control, handling of Covid, disregard of environment
141230	Corrupt hypocrites who support their oligarch friends and do their best to destroy the Constitution.

141240	They dont support the people. They take away rights from women and minorities. I dont agree with their laws including the way they want to protect their gun rights at all costs.
141241	some of the leadership is more radical than I would like to see, there is not a good mix in the age of the party, the party is being strangled be its current leadership.
141244	I don't support their views on Education and gun laws. I'm pro 2nd amendment but there needs to be stronger gun laws with assault rifles, especially.
141246	How they've gone crazy. They seem to be so extreme on most issues and they are very disrespectful. Politics shouldn't be about attacking a person but should be about achieving solutions.
141248	The politicians in both parties largely work for themselves rather than our United States and the American people.
141249	policies that restrict women’s right to choose
141253	Currently it is very divisive.
141257	the same answer as before. there is nothing I currently like about the Republican party
141258	They have become the MAGA party of Trump. They do not value democracy. They only want power.
141260	Misrepresentation of their values for election purposes.
141261	The extreme Republicans speak so many falsehoods as if no one is listening or has the intelligence to hear their hypocrisy and fear of losing by no longer having the moral compass to call out the wrong happening in front of us.
141262	i do not like the religious nature of the party. i do not like the farce of appearance to be for the little guy" while pushing money into the richer people in power. they also seem to have no policy, only the policy to make democrats look like communist or un-American "
141264	Is there still a Republican Party? I'm an independent conservative and I am very sad to see that to the MAGA Hate Party has to replaced to the Republican Party. There is nothing conservative about ineducable blind hatred.
141265	Once upon a time, I had respect for the Republican Party. But their devolution over the past 30 years has been spectacular, from being a participant in governance to total obstacle. And their total abdication and subsequent feasance to Trump since 2016 is historic crazy.
141266	The Republican party has become irrational, threatening and anti democratic.
141267	It has been captured by Donald Trump’s cult of personality.
141268	When they wanted to regain power in Congress and all three branches of the Federal government, they backed Donald Trump
141274	Fanatical. Seems like they believe anything the party says. Blind support.
141275	they dont keep there word, deceitful, they fight among them self, all about money, use anything to win, even, kill still and destroy.
141276	I wish they had a stronger stance for women's rights
141277	The mockery that Trump, his administration, and his followers have made the party. The blatant racism and hate they spew.
141281	None at the present time
141284	I wish the evangelicals would get out of politics
141286	it has been totally corrupted by Trump, MAGA and Mitch McConnell including our Supreme Court
141288	It seems they have turned into a fighting ,bickering bunch among themselves in their quest for power.. I have always been a Republican but not feeling loyal to the changes I see in the party today.
141295	That despite key MAGA party losses in both the house and senate they have allowed themselves to be hostily taken over by a loud minority and have coalesced around a presidential candidate who is the greatest threat to democracy in the history of America all for the merger goal of gaining the executive branch -- a faustian bargain that if successful will prove the downfall of them and this country. History is littered with this story...
141298	not for the people
141300	They have sold themselves out to a conman grifter. And shown total lack of integrity when dealing with him and his cult. Completely indebted themselves to oligarchs and dictators. They no longer believe in democracy, and have done nothing to help middle and working class Americans. And don't even get me started on Project 2025
141301	Tax breaks for the wealthy and leadership
141302	While there have recently been multiple democrats that have left their party, I was saddened by those times a member of the Rep party voted against mainstream republican. I found no good reason. I can't give you names now.. but, it made no sense to me. Not was this question is asking, but I was pro RFK while he was under the Democratic ticket for this presidential election. I was hoping way back for a liaison between him and Trump. RFK seems very sound. His family came up strongly through the Dem party - and I think back then, it was for the working class (even though the Joseph Kennedy was not 'working class'). I definitely don't understand it all as I've never studied politics or the history of politics. I have a lot to learn without a doubt.
141303	They need to start picking candidates that can relate to the American people, maybe a wealthy farmer with business since. That goes for democrats also. Out of all the Americans in this country they pick some pretty awful candidates for us to pick from.
141305	Giving tax breaks to the wealthy, the outlook on the environment, healthcare
141306	Can't get along with the Democrats
141307	Some are RINO and they don't cooperate with each other
141311	Enough republicans have gone far right and don't care about the needs of our country, only following Trump's lead. Several won't even try to make a decision unless they know that Trump will approve.
141312	They back Trump even though they know that he is not a person of character.
141316	Abortion rights, religious views governing human rights, non-equality for humans in general.
141317	pro-life", "pro-guns", bringing religion into politics, banning books, protecting oil and gas vs. the environment "
141322	pander to various groups to win votes
141323	policies, voting, support of trump and backwards human rights
141324	The Republican party no longer exists, it has been overrun by MAGA and Trump, and appears intent on giving our democracy over to a dictator.
141325	Seems to be racists
141327	even when they are presented with evidence they still don't listen
141330	They are compromising more on abortion the closer we get to the election.
141333	Their recent tendencies to spread false information, their worship of Trump and desire to set women's rights back 50 years.
141338	They do not treat people like they are human. It all seems to be focused on religion. It is all about greed. The rich getting rich. I am a religion person, not against it at all but I do not like when it is used as a weapon. That is not what it is for.
141340	Stripped women's rights, biased supreme court, hateful and racist.
141341	I don’t like that they represent the interests of big business.
141342	well I'm born and raised in Galveston Texas so where do you start Abbott Paxton Ted Cruz [CHAR(10)]Dan Patrick...sad
141343	it seems like a joke now, really just about optics, so much of the messaging is based on hate and disenfranchisement
141344	view on abortion rights
141348	Their policies specifically around gun control and reproductive rights
141349	Donald Trump and his corruption
141350	I wish they would move to choice for woman’s reproductive rights.
141352	They don't have morals. They stand behind and support a convicted felon and rapist. They are not for all people.
141353	Donald Trump and everything about him
141354	Sometimes, the Rep party has chosen leaders that bring hype but also feel abrasive (Trump). I am also not a fan of NRA stances with the Rep party. Ultimately, we all want to live in a safe society. Some people think they need guns to be safe and protect. But, other than hunting and for military purposes, I wish they were gone. Also, Rep party has stronger stances on immigration that seem more restrictive than I would agree with.
141355	Their strict abortion policies. I believe in a woman’s right to choose and have access to quality healthcare for female services.
141356	They are not fair in their decision making choices
141358	only concerned about the wealthy
141360	They do not work hard enough to make people more aware of the truth.
141362	Excessive spending
141367	The act like money grubbing, snobby people that think life should be handed to them on a plate. I guess they think they’re entitled .
141368	they are pushing Donald Trump even though nobody actually wants him as president nor do they agree with his politics. they just know he MAY have the best chance at winning so they play the game. They also lie (FEMA, boarder bill, etc) and blame the Democratic Party.
141369	List is too long. reflexively pro war. rarely stick to principals when it matters. are easily moved by negative media coverage.
141370	The candidates seem hateful towards the opposition and the campaign takes on a negative feel instead of telling us how much better they can make things and how they are going to do it
141373	The party has drifted away from their ideals & are now being lead by far right wing radicals.
141374	only concerned about money and power for themselves and their cronies, too much religious ideology, liars or utterly complicit with the liars, hate filled rhetoric, divisive politics, fear-mongers, party does not respect women or minorities
141375	They can't seem to get on the same page and unwind some of the policies the Democrats have put into place.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]They talk a good game, but don't seem to have what it takes to actually get it done.
141376	They have convinced people that forcing future generations to pay taxes to give tax breaks to the wealthy is good for the economy. They deny sound science and medicine when it gives them political advantage.
141377	Growing authoritarian movement, cult-like worship of Trump, discarding of traditional Republican policies
141378	The Republican party sometimes is weak.
141380	Republicans not standing up to Trump. They just cower and worry about their own political power without regard to the consequences for democracy. Dishonesty.
141384	They have no respect for democracy or the rule of law, and they have become a cult of trump.
141385	big business is always lingering and they are for the people
141386	I am against abortion. That is a woman's choice. Both parties need to learn to compromise and think about the citizens and not their personal power. WE NEED TERM LIMITS ON ALL OF CONGRESS! NOT JUST THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATS PUSHING FOR TERM LIMITS ON THE SUPREME COURT WHEN THEY ARE THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM!
141387	Trump controlled and bad decision-making.
141388	No diversity, it is the party of Trump (as witnessed by his killing a bipartisan immigration bill worked on by Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) to be compatible with the party's position. The party refuses to acknowledge the lies of Trump (and continues to push the big lie about nonexistent voter fraud). I also disagree with its positions on taxes, immigration, women's health. And while it talks about supporting families, it's done nothing to help with reestablishing a child care credit or alleviating high levels of student debt.
141391	They are opportunist like so many politicians and when they have an opportunity to do the right thing they can't agree.
141395	they support the rich and leave behind the poor and middle class
141396	all the bicker back and forth
141397	Blind faith to the trump policies and philosophy of MAGA members.
141398	opposition to certain social programs. abortion
141399	They are pro life.
141401	turning into DNC light
141402	the party has turned into a circus.
141403	Anything that is too conservative and too divisive. I would also like to see the Republican party have more awareness about preserving our environment
141405	that they cannot get on the same page, do not like total abortion ban.
141406	they don't seem to stick together on some issues.
141409	My morals do not align
141410	Low trust - there are maybe 10 I trust. Ted is one of them. I trust Marjorie G.
141411	Republicans in name only
141413	they continue to back Donald J Trump!!!!!!! I Do Not Get It!!!!
141414	They seem to have lost their vision but I believe they have a better track record when it comes to international problems
141415	For themselves and the rich, do not have the courage to stand up against Trump
141416	their politics and presidential candidate, trump.
141417	The cult to Trumpism. The Republican party is so mesmerized by the power they associate with Trump that serious political engagement is no longer a reality in this country. The senators and representatives have lost their moral compass because they are afraid to stand up to Trump, except the likes of Cheney, Romney, or Kitzinger.
141418	lack of tolerance, equity, and basic anti-democratic gerrymandering and the imposition of a religious right agenda
141419	there’s a bunch of Rino’s in the party that dont like the way Trump is changing things up
141420	That they couldnt get the super rish to actually back a viable and capable candidate (Niki Haley, Ron Desantis)
141421	their propaganda for guns
141425	they mostly help there rich friends and companies that line their pockets
141427	They gotten rid of most of their moderate and effective Republican congress people, they are only for the rich and big business, they've become racist, they can't govern nor can they compromise, they want to tell everyone how to run their lives, most of their leaders are liars and traitors.
141428	against abortion
141429	same answer as previous question
141431	Absolutely no backbone to stand on moral principles
141432	How Donald Trump influences those in office when he is not even in office. How other Republican candidates were not even given a chance. I did not vote in the Republican presidential primary because my vote would not have made a difference. It was decided before I had a chance to vote.
141433	they fall in line behind trump no matter how stupid/dangerous the issue. self-serving.
141434	I think the Republican party is a threat to equal rights ,affordable education, and they like to push religion
141436	They only think about themselves and how to make the rich man richer.
141437	Rude, arrogant, liars, cheaters
141440	As a history bachelors holder who has studied US history from the 1950s until now, this is an extremely divisive push over the last 20 years for the Republicans to last-ditch-effort take over the US government. It is extremely wild to me that the Republicans have been able to trick poor working class Americans into thinking the 1% of the wealthiest people in the US have the same interest and goals as the bottom 50-80%. The fact that they tout at the same time that the government should stay out of peoples lives while passing bills directly trying to control peoples lives, and their freedoms is not only baffling, but is absolutely un American and should be prosecuted at the highest level of court. Unfortunately, the Republicans of stacked the Supreme Court, which historically was not even supposed to hold the insane power that it does today in our lives. the lifetime that Supreme Court Justice hold was supposed to make them impartial, but it has created a situation where people will take bribes and vote the way the money tells them to. We essentially don’t live in a democratic Republic, but in a capitalist regime.
141442	Their far-right opinions. Their favor of limiting a woman's right to abortion.
141443	the seem to have no teeth. the dems aren’t afraid to go after the gop with Any means necessary and the right never retaliates or even stand their ground most of the time. they seem weak
141444	They want to provide hand-outs to everyone, whether you are legal or not. They don't encourage people to work and better themselves.
141445	trump is a nut job, cant believe he is our candidate
141446	They lie just to get elected and haven't done anything for this country but make it worst. Chinese laws to protect them. No law was put in order to protect black people from Racism and police brutality also immigrants crossing out border killing and rapping our kids. that's not cool
141448	Taking away a woman’s right to abortion. To many to list. Maga insanity has taken over the republicans.
141451	they are dysfunctional and most are “wedded” to Trump
141453	how they don't stick together
141455	anti abortion, no separation of church and state
141461	They abandoned their identity and became a far right populist party that scares me.
141463	they are so divided!!!
141465	dishonesty, threat to democracy, Trump is a wannabe dictator.
141466	good and bad on both sides
141467	assault on women’s reproductive rights, refusal to pass immigration bill, support of Donald Trump
141468	they fail to unify to resist democratic malfeasance
141469	The republic party feels that they have the right to ban whatever they want. Books and abortions are particularly upsetting to me. The Republican Party also supports citizens reporting citizens in these matters which essentially creates a police state and divides people. That shouldn't be allowed. The republican party's current VP pick thinks that women with children are worth more than women without, which is again completely un-American to me.

141491	How can an honorable party that was represented by Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush possibly embrace Donald Trump? He should have been disavowed by the party immediately following the first impeachment and every member of the party should have spoken out against him.
141496	abortion stance, the fact they are agents of gridlock and false election statements
141497	Anyone who supports a person in or out of office who has been convicted of Federal crimes, telling stories without given facts or has on live TV supported riots in my view should not be in office ...that is not what this country is about.

141509	They spend on the rich and cut back programs that help the common people. They go overboard banning abortions even where it makes medical sense. They contracted to build a border fence with their buddy Haliburton, and what fencing there is had already rusted, falling down. Typical old-boys networking, funding projects that benefit companies who contribute to their PACs, and blocking any effort to clean up government corruption. Trump is cruel and heartless to common folk, a neo-Nazi.

141513	they are sheep for trump, they lost their souls… they have NO POLICIES, they are just transactional functionaries of Trump

141521	Almost every policy they advocate. Religious influence, no desire to change

141530	very hypoctricial party. Claim Christianity but do what’s worst for everyone. They don’t seem to want to pass things even in the best interest of their constituents, but want to stop Democrats for passing things for theirs. Pushing conspiracy theories and hatred.
141533	Race baiting politics, cult of personality around Donald Trump, many Republicans still refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election, they have odious views on women's rights and bodily autonomy, their only real policy beliefs are rolling back environmental regulations, and tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. I also never feel fully welcome at their country clubs.

141554	- They're taking away the reproductive rights of women, and will likely go further to more control over everyone's bodies (I'm looking at you, Clarence Thomas).[CHAR(10)]- They give tax breaks to the rich and ultra-rich, aka people who are not struggling.[CHAR(10)]- They have taken over the supreme court and manipulated it to be a strongly conservative and corrupt (again, Clarence) court.[CHAR(10)]- They force ideas of conspiracy and fear to their base constituents.[CHAR(10)]- They are unhappy people that make others unhappy.
141557	Their bigotry and conservatism.
141558	The current Republican Party for the most part focuses on fulfilling the desires of one man, Donald Trump. In that vein, they often do not honor the rule of law. They often vote to deny people rights and freedoms: right to vote, freedom of choice (re abortion), safety in schools. They try to impose Christian right beliefs on everyone (banning books, posting the Ten Commandments). They treat woman, immigrants, minorities, and liberals like second class citizens. They support wealthy and businesses at the expense of the middle class.

141588	overly conservative, weak on gun control, need more moderate views on abortion
141589	corrupt
141591	Limiting freedoms in order to force their ideals and beliefs on others. While I believe we need to remember values and common sense for society, I also don’t believe pushing a narrative of hate and judgement is a way to achieve it, Nor do I think one religious belief is above another. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]It scares me to think of the freedoms me, my children and all of America could lose, to think about the future Project 2025 holds.

141599	They have one aim and that's to try to get Trump elected again regardless of all his criminal charges and insane rants and dishonest tactics at any cost.
141601	This party represents the type of white male that I don't want my boys to grow up to be like. I want them to use their words/brains to solve problems not by force/violence.
141605	They can be bullies and think it is their way or the highway and they have lost the ability to compromise or get anything done.
141606	Their inability to control the take over of the Party by people that are infatuated with a personality cult of Trump." It is hard to be a conservative and successful and not be seen as a "loser and hater" these days when you admit that you support the GOP. "
141607	They have allowed too much political persecution of Trump.
141610	Hostility seems to be increasing.
141611	their entire political approach since Reagan has been winning a team sport rather than governing in good faith; especially since Obama they sacrifice conviction for power and then do nothing but destroy programs that, by the time the effects are seen by their voters, result in blame being placed on opponents so people can vote them in next election season and allow them to do it again. I don't even know what their platform is other than to oppose what is popular and sell it as evil. they consistently support plans that when their opponents support or pass them through legislation they suddenly don't support anymore. l and then blame the opposition for ruining the plan. look at Mitch McConnell. He literally voted against a bill he helped craft just because the Democratic president at the time wanted to sign it. they have zero conviction. none. they blindly follow a man who represents the opposite of everything they pretend to and then utilize the media to sell it as persecution. I don't even know what they stand for anymore and frankly I don't think they do either.

141675	The way that they have allowed Donald Trump to take it over. It is no longer a political party. It has become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump business venture. This is the same thing he wants to do to the entire nation.

141680	they are for themselves

141684	Spineless, not unified in defeating the evil of the Marxist democrats.
141687	As I wrote above, I think the Republican party has drifted very fair in the last couple decades from its original stated values of limited government, personal freedom and fiscal restraint. They have become strident and arbitrary about gun rights, sexual freedoms, and limits to the welfare state. They seem co-opted by big business and the upper class by stubbornly insisting on low taxes and lax regulation at the expense of ordinary people. They come off sounding racist and sexist. Their embrace of a truly terrible, lying, cheating President in the form of Donald Trump to foster their own political futures demonstrates how corrupt they have become.
141688	They are trying to deny racism and hate and they are using the legal system to benefit them.
141689	Rhinos , fake Republicans

141710	In general, there seems to be increasing intolerance and hostility against other points of view
141711	they can’t unite on core principles
141713	The only thing I would say that I don’t agree with, as far as being a republican is the abortion policy.
141718	Donald Trump is am extremist

141720	All the breaks for big business.

141755	position on abortion
141756	The Republican Party has totally become the party of Trump, though there are some members like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger whom I respect very much. The main part of the party is trying to use Trump to put there extreme right-wing ambitions, as in Project 2025, into effect, with zero bipartisanship.
141757	too far to the right
141758	The right wing magna side that seems to be taking over the Republican party.
141759	tying religion with government policy. Anti abortion and LGBTQ rights
141760	anti minority and anti lgbtq stance
141761	The Republican party has moved too far to the right. They are too harsh and do not respect the individual citizen and cater to special interests . The Republican party has allowed itself to become a party that has given control to an individual, Donald Trump, who rules the party through threats and coercion. They have abdicated their loyalty to the country with loyalty to an individual.
141762	Just like any other political party, they seem to have selfish interests
141763	Their insistence on trying to insert Christianity into American politics. It has no place in government. With the exception of a few, most republicans make pitiful excuses for and kowtow to trump. They're spineless imbeciles that won't speak against anything that they know is wrong. They seem to be obsessed with subjugating anyone not white and christian to as many dumb policies as they can come up with.They couldn't govern themselves out of a pothole in the road.
141766	It has undergone a transformation (and not in a good way). It is literally a cult where the allegiance is to one person not the US. They are afraid of embracing change hence why they want to 'go back' to another time
141767	Support of the death penalty, lack of compassion for some.
141769	They appear to be anti-american
141770	Election result denial, support of Donald Trump after he has been proven to be a criminal and a liar, focus on making the rich richer and the poor poorer, Christian Nationalism, position on abortion and taking away women's reproductive choices, stupidity within their Representatives, trying to legislate what they believe is their morality, banning books, banning transgenderism,[CHAR(10)]foreign policy
141771	Neither party, can come to terms over anything, if there was a blue or red Popsicle they would probably argue about that. Instead of what they should agree on or not agree on, what's best for the people!!
141772	On almost all topics they want it their way. There’s very little comprise, if any, even if it would benefit the country.
141773	propagation of lies and wrong information through social media and general engagement bait
141776	Sometimes I feel a lot of Republicans only care about economics or facts to the point where one can seem a bit negligent to the other persons situation.
141777	i feel the republican party has strayed from its conservitive values.[CHAR(10)]i have been a lifelong moderate republican but switched to independent when Trump was elected.[CHAR(10)]the current GOP does not represent anything i believe in.
141778	Even before Trump the Republican party abandoned its principles and became a party solely focused on winning elections. That is the entire point for them. In the past at least they pretended that the point was to win elections IN ORDER TO advance policies. At this point, though, and I think Trump is the inevitable outcome of it, the Republicans are only about winning at any cost. Maybe the Democrats are too, but the part of their party challenging that is louder than for Republicans.
141780	Could fight a little harder
141783	no están unidos
141785	Disingenuous alignment with Trump due to his popularity in his sizeable base, against expansion of healthcare, restriction of abortion rights, increased receptiveness toward false conspiracy theories since the Tea Party movement, which has markedly further increased since Trump's rise to prominence.
141786	Their blind adherence to Trump despite his outrageous, self-serving policies.
141788	They have rallied around Donald Trump and offered him as the best candidate for president - they have chosen a con man to represent their party. They have become extremists and racists. They are all for white males and have been responsible for assault weapons to be legal on our streets. They are conservatives that have taken freedoms hard won by women. They would like to go back to the fifties when white males ruled the country and held women back. They do not like diversity. Need I say more!!!!
141790	They always seem so uptight and their ways of thinking are not always conducive to intelligence so it seems.
141792	I don't like how wishy-washy some of the Republican senators and house of representatives go from indicting Trump and then becoming an admiring supporter of him. These people seem to have blinders on that don't allow them to see his criminal activities.[CHAR(10)]
141793	refusing to work with Democrats for common good of our nation
141794	Every year they slide more left and give in on issues they should be strong on. Its like they are just phoning it in or playing a part to get votes but dont actually care about the values they champion.
141797	Infighting between factions.
141799	anti abortion, too conservative and religious
141803	Too partisan and looking our for their own agendas

141810	as I said earlier, I believe in Universal healthcare and they do not support it. This is very important to me and would be one of the reasons that I might not vote Republican
141811	it seems in recent years, some in a position of power have flip flopped on issues
141812	woman's health rights [CHAR(10)]gun laws [CHAR(10)]energy issues [CHAR(10)]climate strategy
141814	all of their ideology
141820	views on abortion and immigration and women’s matters
141821	they all have their heads up TRUMP'S ASS.
141823	They have sold their souls to Donald Trump, I don't even recognize that party today. In the past I would feel good with a moderate democrat or republican, now I would not trust any republican in office.
141824	Mixing religion with politics. Rigidity. Favoring the money makers with favorable policies. Let's face it, the party is made up of politicians - and that means they eventually become lifers" and far removed from whatever altruistic notions they had which prompted them to become a politician in the first place."
141825	wanting to cut social security, medicare - it's really the party of the rich with no regard for the country as a whole. Promotes inequality.
141826	intolerance, complete devotion to one candidate, MAGA acceptance, no backbone.
141828	They are a house divided. It like follow the leader.
141829	same as democrats but this party bows down to their GOP NOMINEE [CHAR(10)]TRUMP
141830	Like all politicans, they tend to be selfserving first....want a term limitation policy in affect with both local and major elections.Need to attract bright progress thinkers who have success in other fields other than earning from taxpayers as prime funders.
141832	stand of most of them on abortion, inability to get good, necessary legislation passed, their refusal to back Ukraine, their abysmal lack of knowledge about the world/foreign affairs
141833	Sometimes they don't stick together, even when they're in power.
141834	Donald Trump. his an embarrassment
141835	sometimes they have a hard time working together to fight against the left
141836	Self-interests before country, can be bought, deaf to the concerns of the people, arrogant, confrontational, facts don't matter, make up their own rules and operate as if the country is 'stupid' and buying their crap. Self-serving at every level, in every way.
141838	Project 2025, abortion bans, lack of jobs created during Republican presidencies
141840	upper class, dont help poor
141843	their allegiance to Trump
141845	They need to unify and become more effective with getting their message out to be able to beat the corrupt democratic machine.

141849	trump- how he represents the country is catty and pathetic
141852	Selfish, don't have a heart for other mankind
141853	They don't practice being bipartisan. Many Republicans say things that are ridiculous and won't back down even after being fact checked. I feel the Republican Party is willing to win elections even if they have to do it by using illegal means.
141854	Just general things I don’t agree with, such as increased military spending, cruel opposition to illegal immigration, weaving religious intentions into things such as schools and reproductive rights, stances on guns, etc.
141855	MAGA has taken it over and is racist, crazy, and stupid
141856	Viewpoints toward Roe v Wade. I believe it should be federally protected in order to keep others safe in their choices.
141861	Fear mongering. They have shifted from a party of ideas and plans to just shouting at shadows.
141864	RINOS! - Example: Liz Cheney; Mike Pence; Mitch McConnell: Etal.
141865	some people can be irrational
141868	- They do not hold their members accountable as long as it furthers their agenda. They have went fully off the rails after Trump was elected.[CHAR(10)]- They blocked Obama from installing his Supreme Court justices and installed highly partisan hacks and creating an unbalanced court.[CHAR(10)]- They have to lie to get their unfavorable agendas passed (Roe v Wade being settled law -> undoing Roe v Wade saying states should decide -> Trying to ban abortion nationwide, etc.)[CHAR(10)]- Many of the things they do/say are pretty disgusting.
141869	abortion laws, political agenda, the Supreme Court judges and their decisions, Donald Trump
141872	In general I think politics bring out the worst in people from both sides. I don't like the polarization where there is no room for civil debate. Power is too concentrated in both parties so there is dynamic that you are either with us or against us". "
141873	They have allowed Donald Trump to rise to power a second time. There is no Republican Party-it's now the Trump Party
141874	It seems that republicans need to stand stronger on policy against democrat legislation that they may know is not good. I think strong leadership in the congress is very important.
141877	Afraid of some of the things they stand for
141881	SK

Favortism toward gun rights advocacy money over citizen safety. Tendency to attack opponents personally rather than run on a real platform and offer solutions.
141887	The Republican party has waffled and no longer stands for the principles that it did 50 years ago. It doesn’t really stand for anything anymore. I do not really consider myself to be a Republican.
141890	not willing to work in the same room. More prone to tear done other members rather than try to work with them.
141891	position on abortion; their hypocrisy; their current leadership
141893	Too divisive and more interested in getting in control than really working together to keep this great county working as a true democracy.
141894	Regressive ideas and policies, causing issues for the country in the name of the party, can't seem to go against what Trump says (see border deal that he tanked), conservatives haven't really ever been on the right side of history, members espousing and repeating lies and blatant fear mongering and racism
141895	they are way to conservative, and they out right lie

141978	they appear to be racist and do not like immigrants in general
141979	They don't work together like they should

141981	specifically how nearly the entire party fell to licking Trump's boots. the lot of them have so much greed and grifting going on, and power hungry games. America has never had a perfect system, but we have had a reasonable one, and I feel that the insanity behind the Republican party has caused some great damage
141982	They are a bunch of idiots! All they do is kiss Trumps ass to save their jobs. Look how many people went to prison for him!!!! HE IS SUCH A FRAUD!!!!!!!

142014	I don't like the way the Republican party as a whole (and there are exceptions) is capitulating to Donald Trump's extremist views and agenda. The mostly conservative Supreme Court's Overturning of Roe vs. Wade and other extreme decisions is a blatant example of the loss of women's rights and thus freedom for all citizens.

142035	I don't like the fracturing of the Republicans some republicans are Democrats in disguise and they only are in the republican party to create issues. I have over the years voted Democrat and Republican, one year even Green party. Both parties need a reworking and clarify what each party stands for in this country
142043	The current Republican party is stripping individuals of their rights, promoting hate and division, and allows for policies that hurt the environment and population.
142044	the Republican Party take take and take away from the poor and give to the rich.

142057	Tend to follow the money.
142059	The extreme right has control of the Republican party. I like what Naomi Klein writes in Doppleganger about a Mirror World" that is the rhetoric of the Republican party. This arms race of words and stories and "alternative facts" is extremely damaging and dangerous. It's damaging to individual relationships in the world, it's damaging to our sense of what is real and what to believe. I feel this problem falls squarely onto the Republican party and the media outlets that support it."
142061	I dislike the rabid disregard for basic empathy and the needs of the majority of Americans.
142062	Their views on reproductive rights, gay rights, religion
142063	They need to be more united.

142081	Want to control a woman's body, anti-LBGTQ, racist, far right Christian attitudes
142082	abortion, guns, immigration.
142084	Their current open hostility to civil and voting rights. Anti-women, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ.[CHAR(10)]Their continued support of failed economic policies like trickle down economics, their unquestioning fealty to the rich.
142085	perception of Favoring the Wealthy, Social Issues Stance, Environmental Policies, Immigration Policies, Lack of Diversity
142094	They don’t stand up for themselves as a party
142095	They have been overrun by liars and charlatans. You can't trust anything they say or do.
142096	They are turning into the American Taliban. They will subject women to the worst kind of treatment. They will do away with the educational system. They will destroy this country. We will end up in a dictatorship under their rule.
142097	It would take an hour to answer. Start with lying, wasting time, believing things that are clearly not true. etc.
142098	religiosity, racism, Donald trumps influence, corporate shills, social policy in general, hypocrisy
142099	They have not demonstrated sound leadership. Some of them know that Donald Trump is wrong for the things that he does and yet, they support him. Others talk about him in private conversations because they are afraid of him and his supporters just because they want to stay in power. They are cowards who have no strong leadership. They should put country first.
142100	the Republican Party is no longer the party of law and order
142103	Republicans in name only - we have too many who say they will do something for us and then after they have been voted in - don't follow through and in most cases vote like the democrats.
142104	Donald Trump the convicted rapist and felon, J D Vance, the hate they spew, their thoughts on women, their comment about Black Jobs, their racist thoughts, the negativity , the lies.
142105	They practice far right Christian nationalism, they are not inclusive, they promote racism
142107	They don't seem to be able to keep the base on message and band together to get things done the way the Democrats do. There is too much infighting. Politics is about compromise, and there is room to do so when it doesn't require you to violate a core principle. The GOP seems to be expert in snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
142108	everything it is
142110	It's become a reactionary party that exists to serve Trump and to own the libs, even if that means owning the republican voters. It's filled with openly racist people and policies. It's become a Christian party and it's trying to force the country to adopt Christian beliefs. It's vitriolic and cruel in is messing.

142122	they dont want to fix any issues just cause problems because they don’t want any democrats to win on anything
142125	fighting within the party
142126	they have no independent thoughts and follow Trump blindly

142133	Too many moderate leaning members.
142134	The members are afraid to speak out against individual wrongs.
142135	too many rino's
142137	to put forth a criminal as candidate. to endorse a radical like Vance. to manipulate the Supreme Court to dysfunction. to not have let Obama put a justice on Supreme Court. to think they own and control women's bodies.
142138	It used to stand for principle, integrity, now it stands for grift, ridiculous candidates, and stupid ideas that are intended for show, screwing around with national security and our allies, and just crazy conspiracy theories (not talking about the moderate Republicans, but many of them are leaving Congress and some even leaving the party.)
142139	The myth of the trickle down effect is still being trumpeted by these guys. They're all about making more money with less government interference about how they run their business. They don't think about their neighbors or the environment at all, it seems. It's all about what's in their back pockets at the end of the day.
142141	Donald Trump being their candidate because he does not represent any of the republican views
142142	the party is not cohesive. they fail in getting things done
142143	All thay do is try to blame others and do not do the job the people want.[CHAR(10)]All of them are crooks.
142145	i think they take abortion laws to far. should be less government control.
142146	Republicans honestly hate everthing except lower taxes for rich people. The party of crushed hope. Republicans don't believe in Democracy and the right to vote. They think name calling is a productive form of politics. Never compromise. Overturned roe v wade. Republicans are no longer separating Church and State. They have protected Trump for years, complete cowards.
142148	They are selfish and care only about themselves
142152	abortion policies
142153	Many times the Republicans seem to acquiesce to some of the liberal ideas simply to try and GET ALONG. This is a waste of time. They need to stand together always and not split support especially when a candidate needs it.
142154	trumps control of the party
142155	They don’t give a crap about persons who aren’t rich, the climate, safe gun laws, persons they don’t “deem” worthy (non-Christians, non-Whites, etc.).
142162	The Republican party could have done something about the immigration problem but chose to follow Donald Trump like the rats that followed the Pied Piper. I am so ashamed of the way the just blindly follow Trump. It's like they cannot think for themselves or are very afraid of offending him.
142163	They still on Trump side
142164	They are corrupt, hypocritical liars. They put party above country and are childish when they do not get their way. The economy suffers. The people suffer.
142165	too close minded
142169	Their economic policy is terrible. The party seems entirely designed around how they can give money and power to the rich. Everything else about the party seems to be culture war wedge issues that they'll adopt any position to earn votes as long as it lets the rich stay rich.
142171	lack of support for public education
142172	Taxes, their policies on pretty much everything
142175	The leaders seem to weak and afraid to speak the actual hard facts and truth about the evils and enemies that our country is facing. They are weak. They do not stand strong and loud in speaking out SO THAT THEY CAN'T BE IGNORED! They just let the media lies go unchecked.
142176	They follow the lead of a compulsive liar & will whatever he suggest. The members don't seem to think for themselves.
142177	lack of bi partisanship
142182	I don't think that in 2024 taking away women's right to choice an abortion should even be a question.
142187	I don’t like the war on women.
142190	only care about their party priorities
142191	Too many Trump followers and contributors to treating different opinions as the enemy, rather than working together for the People.
142193	Too right wing and negative about our country.
142194	Republican Party no longer represents my thoughts with the people leading the party
142195	While the GOP is opposed to non-therapeutic abortion, the policy they do espouse is too draconian. The GOP is corrupt. Its politicians are ignorant, authoritarianism worshiping hacks. They are reactionary, racist, deniers of both experimental and pure science. They kowtow to the rich and hyper-rich and demagogues in other countries. They are fear-mongers. They rely on the hate, fear, and prejudices of their constituents to stay in power, and they gin up those feelings in them. They oppose ANY reasonable efforts to effect reasonable limits to the 2nd amendment (which a majority of Americans support). In short, the GOP comprises the worst sort of tyranny: the tyranny of the minority over the majority.
142196	abortion,,, too inclusive,,[CHAR(10)]far right politicians

142218	too many RINO, too many politicians ... the same for the democrats /
142219	The Republican Party is more concerned with pandering to businesses and people with income over $100,000. This is combined with lying to the people with less income, tricking them into believing that the Republican leadership actually cares about the average people of the USA.
142220	I have voted for republicans in the past but the republican party of today is not the party I would ever vote for today. They've become lemmings following Trump blindly. They are undoubtedly Project 2025 ready.
142223	They are not always the most interested in environmental protection. I also believe that just like other parties, most candidates in the republican party are power hungry and not always looking out for the best interest of the middle class
142225	The pro gun stance and how assault rifles should be able to be purchased by civilians, the strict stance on abortion.
142226	changing decision because Trump tells them to
142228	Their stance that all people do not have the same rights. Their inability to understand that government is a business that in many cases can provide better scale and support to the nation.
142229	It's truly no longer a party, rather an extension of the Trump cult.
142231	don't liike that they're against abortions
142232	my words are inadequate
142233	I don’t like how divisive and extreme the party has become. I consider myself to be more of a conservative republican, and the party has gone too far to the right. I’m also uncomfortable with how infatuated the party is with Donald Trump.
142239	I don't like that over the years they've allowed MAGA to infest the party and that they've leaned so heavily into the conservative Christian movement. They have allowed religion and the religious movement to become such a huge part of their agenda and identity that they've forgotten that this country was partially founded by individuals seeking to avoid religious persecution. They have forgotten that one of the fundamental concepts of our Constitution is a separation of Church and State and that we are NOT, in fact, a Christian nation, and that individual religious freedom is and should be a fundamental tenant. They continue to insist on pushing and imposing their ideals of Christian values on the rest of the country in an attempt to reform and entire nation and it's not only morally corrupt but completely counter to the way this country was formed and to the very nature of the Christian values they claim to espouse.
142240	Their attempt to continuously ban the right to choose.
142246	poca Solidaridad en crímenes de Alexa Humanidad de Autocratasby dictadores como Vladimir Putin, Nicolás Maduro, Dictadores de turno de la Dictadura Cubana, Nicaragüense y de Coreandel Norte y de los Ayatolas Iraníes.
142248	They refuse to agree to any sensible gun restrictions. They base their anti-abortion stance on being “pro-family” yet once those children are born, they wash their hands of these “welfare mothers” and their innocent children. They want to impose their morality on everyone instead of letting others pursue[CHAR(10)]life, liberty, and happiness as each individual sees those things.
142249	Roe vs Wade overturned,Gun carry law, permitless concealed and carry
142251	they are so afraid of trump they will lie for him
142254	tough stance on abortion laws
142258	They take away all the programs/benefits that help the middle class or low income.
142259	The Republican Party has no moral standing, and actively harms both the people of America and also our democratic system. They are only concerned with power - every chance they get to show some vision of how to help, they recede to the deepest corners of the worst parts within us. They are a full on disgrace to humanity.
142261	The lie and have a radical agenda that takes away peoples rights.
142262	tax cuts for the rich, hiding true intentions behind lies, banning abortions
142266	Their devotion to Donald Trump truly escapes me! They've lost all sense of reason to promote this man!
142267	They don’t want to compromise with anyone.
142270	Today’s Republican Party is completely out of touch with reality. Wealth inequality is devastating the working class, with stagnant wages and the wealthy exploiting the economic system for their own gain. Instead of addressing these issues, today’s Republicans seem focused only on gaining more power and money. This is why they back unlimited money in politics, allowing their wealthy allies to have excessive influence, and support Trump’s Supreme Court, which seeks to grant him immunity from prosecution for crimes committed while in office.
142271	Donald Trump's control over it
142272	first, apathy. second—could they PLEASE come up with a better candidate than trump. third, party affiliation (strength) supersedes constituents best interests.
142273	Wholesale embrace of Trumpism and populism. Stance on Ukraine.

142279	RNC is the american Talaban
142281	Several Republicans back Donald Trump because they are afraid of the attacks from him
142282	I dislike it whenever they back down on pro-life issues.
142283	The extreemist folks, the focus on party above ethics, the crazy following of Trump even with all he has done poorly and the cost to our country in his last presidency! Yeesh! From there I have a problem that they focus on the wealthy and the CEO's vs the marginalized. i used to respect the Republicans while I didn't fully agree with their policy focus. Now it is hard to respect their blindness and choice to put party over policy. Teh support of Evangelical groups on the issues of abortion, gun rights, Trump, CEO's, Russia, etc has created a strange skew to the full party. Other issues include blaming others about the very things they are doing in their own practice, creating so many lies that they start sounding truthful to otherwise rational people. The misuse of funding, the poor connection to other countries, and their choice of keeping their guns to play with vs creating safe situations to reduce shootings. I wish all party politicians were required to complete community hours where they experience the life of a single mother with children at minimum wage, where they pick produce in a field, where they see the damage of COVID in a hospital, where they are on the line with police or fire and military. Too many assumptions are made about planned parenthood with concrete decisions that don't recognize the reality of this care for women with no health care, etc. And the reality of their focus on removing all abortion options, IVF, etc. Very blind to what ll this means for an individual much less the nation... Similarly, the private prisons and so much more...
142284	they have pledged their allegiance to djt. it’s an abomination

142297	They want to keep poor as poor.[CHAR(10)]They don't want to tax rich people
142301	They're motivated by the Trump base.
142302	Not in favor of those who think along the lines of Republican right / Democrat wrong, no matter the issue.
142303	THE GOP has lost its identity and have succumbed to hate and bigotry to try and achieve their goals. I don't consider them to be a political party any more as they seem to operate more like a mob family, promoting only those that are loyal" to their leader. Anti-democratic and un-American."

142308	stop making trouble talk about thing that the poor worker need. and stop bullying 😤
142311	The fear and anger driven policies that are reactionary. The isolationism front the rest of the world. The lack of a backbone to stand up to the worst of its members. The underhanded ways in which the Supreme Court justices were selected and the lack of honesty from leadership on the process. The push towards a religious based platform instead of one based on the constitution. I used to think of myself as a fiscal conservative but now I wouldn’t touch the Republican Party with a 10 foot pole.
142313	I largely disagree with their ideology.
142315	They are way too aggressive to the point of obnoxious. [CHAR(10)]They want to combine church with state.[CHAR(10)]Banning abortion.

142320	Their views on healthcare, abortion, and Project 2025
142321	Party has forgotten its roots. Too many war hawks, supporting too many foreign wars. As Kennedy calls these, the forever wars. The party has forgotten Eisenhower's warning about Military Industrial Complex.
142323	They seem to be very immature and teach our children to name call and give out disinformation or throw shade" rather than work on specific ways to heal our country. I used to be kind of in the middle on subjects and now I feel the country is so extreme... and I blame the Republicans. "
142327	I am afraid for the future of our country's democracy if Trump wins in November
142329	I dislike the Republicans blind allegience to Donald Trump, big business, and the super rich. I disagree with their views on women's rights, the separation of church and state, and their hypocrisy concerning many issues.
142330	DO NOT FOLLOW THOURGH OFTEN ENOUGH WHEN FINDING WRONG DOING TO BOTH IDENTIFY AS WELL AS PROSECUTE.
142332	They lie, they put party over everything even foul actions of their own members. The stance on abortion and their willingness to allow women to die rather than have rights over their own healthcare.

142349	They are not the Republican Party anymore. They do not seem to have minds of their own, they complain a lot rather instead of focusing on what needs to be done to improve or keep America going. They've become radicalized in a very strange way. Unsettling.
142352	Seem to favor the rich more while ignoring middle class. Not progressive enough on social issues
142355	seem to stand by instead of standing up to extreme democratic ideals. Often don’t provide a voice for even moderate republicans.
142356	not encouraging Asian intellectuals in every steps of the party
142358	Push lots of bad policy, especially at the national level.
142359	waste their time continuously throwing spaghetti against the wall on frivolous investigations and not working on the issues. most dysfunctional party that continues to implode within. I don’t know how they look at themselves in the mirror.
142360	They don't care about the people of the country. They don't care about women, children, or minorities. The don't care about the environment. They only care about money
142363	Everything. The Republican party is no longer a functioning political entity. It is owned and filled by trump, MAGA and white christian nationalists who do no believe in democracy.
142365	They have been taken over by christian extremists.
142366	No backbone they let a loose cannon run the party.
142367	they rarely offer solutions or make decisions.they always criticize the decisions that are made. they also are very petty and hypocritical…”don’t look at me look at that guy”.
142369	Dont support the middle class.
142370	Many Republicans align themselves with the military industrial complex and don't do enough to end the war in Ukraine through negotiation.
142371	in house bickering, not always sticking together
142372	Most are just weak and wont fight
142373	-need to soften stance on abortion[CHAR(10)]-still a lot to catch up to match Democrats
142376	they want to control how we live. religion should never be a part of politics
142379	I don't like the party's position on abortion either. This should not be a matter of Law. I also feel the republican party is allied more with business.
142380	stance on reproductive rights and lack of interest in examine safer gun laws
142381	republicans roll over, they let the Democrats make the narrative. republicans dont explain their positions well to convice people to support
142384	They also push for more government.
142387	They don't stand together and fight for what is right for the American people.
142388	The Republican party has embraced numerous wingnut extremist positions: eliminating the Federal Reserve and returning to gold standard or compromising the FRB's independence of POTUS, deporting millions of people who pick our strawberries and work in meat packing plants and who pay taxes and are even potential socially conservative Republican voters, and they have taken even more extreme refusal to work with the other party in order to solve serious problems. Nikki Haley was the only successful primary candidate who had the potential to bring back to normal Republican policies, although policies I also disagree with, but she could not get majorities in any Republican primary. The Heritage Foundation used to be normal with normal economists working there doing normal Republican policy research such as against the minimum wage and for virginity pledges, and now they are producing extremist position papers like Project 2025. The Republican party is also evangelical Christian, rather than mainline Christian, and mainline Christianity is basically non-existent, with only 9% of Americans being mainline Protestant, down from 1/3 in the 1970s and over 1/2 in the 1950s. The decline of mainline Protestantism is related to the extremism that we see in the political sector. Republicans say people should go to church more, which would probably be beneficial for society, but what they mean is people should go to evangelical churches more, which is what brings the polarization and absolutist positions like being against all abortion and ironically also now IVF. That equation of church with evangelicalism makes middle of the road Protestant Americans see church as extremist, rather than mainstream, and it adds to the loneliness and social disconnection that created Trump and destroyed the moderate wing of the Republican party.
142390	War mongering and unethical foreign policies[CHAR(10)]
142393	They haven't taken control of the national debt, spend too much time and energy in-fighting rather than working together to solve problems, and too many of them are still part of the D.C. swamp.
142397	misguided attachment to outdated social issues, willingness to spread invective and hate
142398	Not enough concern for social issues.
142399	anti abortion
142403	again full of old men telling me as a woman I cannot think or should be at home I would not put it past Trump to take the vote away from women
142404	Their views on abotion
142406	I believe in the right to choose abortion, I believe in gay rights
142409	Abortion they say no to it. I dont think women should use it as birth control but it is a necessary evil. If you are raped or medically need one you should be able to get one. I also think 12 yr olds that end up pregnant should be able to get one, but with that again she shouldn't be able to continue getting them there needs to be regulations on it
142410	The evolution of their current ideology. Their support of Trump as a candidate and the lack of accountability they hold him to
142412	just plain mean
142413	they are following Trump, instead of thinking for themselves
142415	for wealthy only. ever their religious stands are for power. are not for the people. worst hypocrites.
142416	They are mostly like Trump.
142417	Everything is about money and they can NOT separate church and state like it is supposed to be
142418	 any possibility of people loosing ssi and health insurance for people that were born in this country
142419	I feel as if the far right has gone too far and their compassion for others who believe differently are driving our country further apart as a nation. exact thing can be said of far left
142420	lies, nepotism in the Trump family
142421	their stance on abortion- it’s a life. they are still for killing a life.
142423	The blurring of separation of church and state
142425	RINO'S Republicans that are siding with Democrats
142428	inability to totally unite and give in to continuing resolutions [CHAR(10)]not being strong enough to stand up to demanding line item veto [CHAR(10)]
142430	It seems like that are for certain groups of people, and that they are hell bent on division. They will not work with , compromise or see another way for the good of the people. NOT TAKE DOWN, OR STOP BELIEVING
142431	Name calling and January 6 insurrection
142433	approach to abortion rights[CHAR(10)]immigration policy [CHAR(10)]Tax cuts for rich people[CHAR(10)]health care policy

142440	The Republican party has moved too far to the right.
142441	Stances on abortion, LBGT issues, and their opposition to public education
142442	rhinos, rhinos, rhinos
142443	as I stated previously, there is no longer a Republican party. It is the Trump cult. I do not believe in nor do I condone the Trump cult, and as long as they follow him, I will refuse to acknowledge their existence.
142445	I am shocked that they nominated and stand behind Donald Trump who is a criminal
142446	The conservative values that once defined the republican party are gone and I'm not sure what the party stands for now. It is run by the radical right wing minority.
142447	voting for omnibus bills
142448	abortion/woman's rights stance
142449	willful ignorance
142451	The them-against-us" mentality and their inability to cross party lines to get bills passed for the good of the general public. They let the most partisan people of their party rule them, while most of the country is moderate. Plus they, for some unfathomable reason, back Donald Trump."
142452	Currently, many of them appear to have forgotten their roots and they appear to be following a charismatic leader (or one how appears to be charismatic). Many of them appear to do everything they can to gain said leader's endorsement and appear to have done many things to support said leader's goals, even if those goals aren't what's best for the country.
142454	The dangerous MAGA movement, the misogyny, the racism, and the 2025 plan which I’ve read. These are scary people.
142455	they act like democrats sometimes
142456	I feel that the GOP has made their policy to back Trump at all costs. They do not govern anymore in the Senate and constantly block policy behind partican politics. They have made a mockery of the Senate and Congress by how their elected representives act. People like Ted Cruz from Texas are insulting to our democracy. They govern with a sense of insults and lies.
142458	I really cannot get passed how they dealt with January 6th
142459	Old guard GOP who like to ignore constituents.
142460	they support the BIG LIE and they all know it’s a lie.
142462	they don’t work with the other side and they’re not true fiscal conservatives
142464	Often fractured and unable too work together for common goals
142465	 o one seems to think on their own
142466	Party or herd mentality is more important than dealing with issues.
142469	I wish that the majority of the republican party were not so racist againt blacks & jewish people[CHAR(10)] because me as a black woman want them to know that we are all for the same cause . Our Country!
142472	They cater to the rich and powerful and make it hard on middle class families in America.
142473	The Republican Party has lost credibility with me because they give in to the demands of a few extremist party members who are are racist, sexist, bigoted, uneducated, self-centered, untrustworthy, and unintelligent. As a party they seem far more focused on being in power and defeating Democrats than with actually creating and implementing policies that help citizens. Their vision for the USA is more restrictive, controlling, conservative and based in fear than a place I'd like to live. They support the NRA and do nothing to help stop mass shootings. They aim to further restrict abortion rights. They refuse to acknowledge and teach real, true history and instead prefer to ban books and whitewash things.
142474	They have better candidates to run in elections
142476	They've become too extreme and working on lies. No backbone.
142479	i FEEL THAT THEY TRY TO HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
142483	lack of gun control on assault guns and making abortion basically illegal and doing nothing to help the middle class.
142484	Trump as a nominee
142489	l do not like the people that they have chosen to run the party.
142490	They have lost their moral compass.
142491	Often just don't get things accomplished as they tend to lack unity,
142492	against women's rights
142493	trying to limit Women’s rights, school rights and banning books
142498	outspoken public criticism of opposition
142501	Their complete allegiance to Donald Trump, even though the vast majority were quite clear about this distain for him during the summer of 2016, their support of all the rhetoric and hate speech started by their lord and master Trump, their banding together with the extremist christian nationalists, their misogyny.
142502	They've turned crazy - they're following Trump like a cult.
142503	they don’t always have the people’s best interests in mind
142505	the handling of abortion and religion
142506	I'm not sensing a lot of integrity on the part of present day Republicans.
142507	Abortion policy, lack of an immigration policy, foreign affairs, deficit and spending policies
142508	The gun laws being supported
142511	Embracing Christian nationalism. Submitting to the popular vote of Donald Trump by the vocal minority instead of aligning with their performed morality and not promoting or allowing someone like Trump who is with very low ethics and morality. Embracing the MAGA culture and people. Promoting isolationist ideology.
142512	The Republican Party denying that President Trump did not lose the 2020 president election
142514	Too much arguing among the party.
142515	They will not pass any reasonable gun control laws. They have blocked any major effort to control the border, making Biden look bad. They block so many things in Congress.
142518	Project 2025 🚨🚨
142519	some are a little over the top of what i consider even for all.
142520	just certain things some times, prefer not to discuss
142523	The Republican Party used to have differing views and a more moderate stance on most policy. They have completely followed Donald Trump's views and voted in lock with him. He is a person that has made it so that a president really doesn't have the same checks and balances on their decisions as in the past. He should not be trusted with out checks and balances. His party has completely supported his actions on Jan. 6 and the rulings of the Supreme Court. He should be held accountable for his actions and have his day in court.
142524	many vote with the democrats so they can get paid or are too lazy to know what they're voting for. many are career politicians only working for their financial benefit- not the good of the people
142526	Best way to phrase it, the Republican party is the equivalent of an arsonist burning something down, then tell you the other side didn't put it out. They were able to get a very restrictive border bill to the President's desk; when he was ready to sign it, they said pulled it. They didn't want to give President Biden a win. I would have slam dunked on the President, saying he is weak and ineffective, we made the President bend to our will...
142528	pro life [CHAR(10)]less tax on the elites
142529	pushes Christian faith and ideologies.
142532	Interested in helping the richest people
142535	First and foremost they are trying to take women backwards 50+ years. Then it’s the ultra wealthy who benefit from their policies in general
142537	it’s everyone for themself[CHAR(10)]no integrity
142538	The vast majority of republic party politicians are slow motion statist and have never scaled back any law, regulation, or tax.
142540	Their stance on women's rights
142541	nothing there just doing good
142543	The way the party won't always push for what they believe in. Also, there is too much in-fighting.
142544	The party does not advocate for all people and have actively participated in stripping rights away for the people of this country.
142545	They don't care about the lower class or the middle class. They are cold and callus.
142546	SK
142548	Support of police, israel, lack of gun control, pushing of COVID misinformation, women's issues, LGBTQIA issues, abortion rights, childcare, housing crisis
142550	Too much talk and not enough action.
142551	economy police, and how to control gun
142555	this party is all about people with money no so much about the everyday working class people.
142557	they don’t do what they Say they’re going to do fiscally. There’s a lot of war mongers, A lot of them are just too old. And if they don’t have much of a backbone. They’re too easily swayed.
142559	They're All Afraid Of Trump
142561	I think that the many members of the Republican party are extremely hypocritical - they make a lot of fancy promises and then do the exact opposite. They take credit for legislation that they did not vote for, and that they tried to stop from passing. They are racist towards African Americans, and more recently, the Republican party has become racist to Hispanics. They claim to want small government, but they vastly extended the surveillance capacities of the NSA and Homeland Security. When Roe v Wade was overturned, Republicans started to monitor women's private medical records and offered rewards to track and follow women to another state. They claim they will lower the budget, but they start senseless and unnecessary wars that are very expensive - they lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and sent soldiers into battle for made up reasons. Unnecessary wars increase the defense budget and result in physical and emotional damage to US soldiers. Republicans refuse to stand up to large corporations, especially the pharmaceutical industry and negotiate lower prescription prices. Inflated drug prices increase spending for Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans refused to stand up to the oil indistry and did not acknowledge climate change was real. We could have been switching away from gas fueled csrs twenty to thirty years ago and really working towards reducing emissions of CO2 if Republicans hadn't been bought and paid for by the oil industry.
142563	They lie and care about their own pocket
142568	I don't align with a lot of their beliefs.
142571	the radicalizations and extreme views on many things
142572	abortion rights
142573	Less government means less help for those who really need it.
142576	Segregated, secret agenda to keep the majority of citizens in a negatively impacted state throughout all federal, state and local government means.
142577	Their blind support of Trump, and their stance on Roe v Wade.
142578	cowardly, don’t fight hard enough like Democrats do
142580	They have turned into a MAGA organization instead of the Republican Party. So many Blindly support Trump even when they don't politically align with him. They are un knowingly moving towards Big government with the very specific laws they are putting in place.
142582	they seems to be Trump dominated and care less about the lower class and immigrant
142584	They are only in support of and for Trump. They don't care about the American people. They just want to stay in power. They are very hypocrital and have fallen from the party they once were.
142585	In the frenzy to retain power, they pander to groups of people that I don't agree with (religious zealots, racists, the NRA, etc.) on a number of social topics that I find abhorrent (book banning, revocation of all abortion rights, lax gun laws, etc.). Either the party has lost touch with facts/reality and civility or it has lost touch with moral rectitude.
142587	Concern only for big business, election deniers, hatred of immigrants, totally white supremists
142590	Cant seem to unite as a party to get things done.
142594	They did not fight the negative pall cast by Trump and cowered in fear of his supposed (self-declared) power while wide-spread racism, xenophobia, and misogyny were unleashed upon a once-decent country.
142597	There was a time where my friends and colleagues voted Republican and I could see their choice merely as a difference of opinion. There were republican politicians I respected and admired--even if I didn't always agree with them on every issue. They were thoughtful and seeking solutions and open to learning. Now, it feels that opportunities for discourse are shut down. And the leaders of the party are inflammatory and without a moral compass.
142598	don’t like that they want to take away women rights, and the way they want to blame transgender for the pedophiles and rapist.
142600	Their strong affiliation with Christianity, the pro-life movement (but wanting to cut support for families who cannot support children), gun regulation
142601	They don't always present a united front
142604	There are too many career politicians that just want to line their pockets with cash!!!
142606	The Republican party seems to want to take America backward. They do not want women to have control over their own reproductive rights. They want to deport millions of people, instead of working to fix our immigration system. They do not support the LGBTQIA+ and other minority communities. They want to game the system in order to keep themselves in power.
142607	only care about the richest people and Corporations and don't support Unions. and taking our freedoms away
142609	That it cowers to Donald Trump and his supporters
142610	They have too many vocal people who are uneducated and believe and fight for issues that are not true.
142612	they don't always stand up to the democratic party like they should[CHAR(10)]
142613	they are unhinged.
142614	when they side with democrats
142617	I feel the party is more concerned about pushing Christian values over what's actually best for the country. a seeming continued effort to reduce the rights of women is also highly concerning
142619	seeming to all have racist views and want to end abortion
142620	Most of them needs to be more conservative and speak up and fight harder.
142622	the far rights increasing influence and anti-intellectual movement. Religion in government. Take over of the courts to implement and support of regressive social policies like overturning roe v wade. Many politicians able to still remain in congress without any repercussions for evidence lacking statements, even when extremely racist, homophobic, outlandish, etc.
142626	They are hypocritical,prejudiced and promote HATE to our country!
142629	most of the time there for the rich
142632	They are in a Donald Trump cult
142635	I don't like that they vilify the other party.

142650	have strayed from position on personal / individual rights. captive to religious right and trump personality cult. failing to capitalize on energy transition as a winning issue. too much pandering to fringes versus galvanizing the core.
142653	too involved in abortion, too involved in others’ social values that have nothing to do with their own (gay rights and overall they have low social tolerance beyond the nuclear family).
142654	they r all working together for wars
142656	they lack morals and the ability to think critically about the lives of people who are different from them.

201192	I was a registered Republican for most of my life. But now they are inexplicably beholden to Trump and are no longer the Republican Party. They are mean, nasty, shallow. They are more concerned about their party “winning” than in getting things done for America. The immigration issue is a perfect case in point. They kowtowed to Trump. Why? 
201216	they don’t stand united as a party.

202619	Self-serving, power-hungry. Don't show any care for the average citizen. Waste time and resources on conspiracies. Overt corruption and lack of accountability. 
202630	The unwavering support for Donald Trump...it appears there is a genuine fear of Trump which leads to Republican Party support 
202660	older established members do not follow the will of their constituents 
202671	they are too extreme. not truth to the American people 
202689	All the members of the party need to stand together. 
202791	Lack of women’s rights, fracking, lack of environmental etc 
202861	if you are going to run for President be in right frame of mind testing Mental health should be first priority and physical fit all should give the voters [CHAR(10)]results so people think the don't have to and no one should ever be against the law not fair at all 
202873	I think their politicians cultivate a spirit of paranoia and selfishness among their voters 
202879	There is a lot that I don't agree with Republican politics but the main one that would stop me from making my vote Republican is the abortion issue. The government can't make or create a baby so they should not have a say how a woman decides to take care of her mental and physical health. No one should be able to say whether a woman can or can't legally decide to make her health care decisions. 
202951	I think I wrote what I don’t like in the last question. so there isn’t really anything I like and I’d like to change my party to independent 
203035	republicans in the house refused to consider a bipartisan bill from the senate on border security. politics are about compromise. 
203053	immigration stance 
203177	helping only the rich? 
203219	their racism and anti-immigrant rhetoric 
203225	they will eat the poor to feed the rich and it’s gross. they only care about their agenda. 
203248	Their stand against immigration and their support of racist people. 
203254	They are a bunch of individuals who hate the left side of the table. 
203290	embrace of racists. no respect for norms. no respect for nonwhite citizens. too pro business, millionaire/billionaire class 
203307	the best candidate that they came up with is Donald Trump 
203325	Too much misinformatioin. 
203331	Foreign Policy in relation to Latin American countries as-well Asian Countries. 
203337	can be divisive....there must be a way for both parties to work together 
203372	they have opportunity to get more done and always giving way to the Democratic Party proposals 
203384	The complete acceptance of misinformation and the unwavering loyalty to the cult of Trump. 
203390	It's the party that seems to welcome bigots, racists, White supremacists and Christian nationalists, who do not want an inclusive nation and would just as soon void parts of the Constitution to achiee their ends. Their focus on ending abortion across the country is dangerous; their denial of voting rights is in line with fascists. 
203414	they have become facistic 
203489	They only help rich people 
203571	they suck badly handle the government 
203698	only for the rich 
203710	they would not even debate the bipartisan bill presented to the Senate 
203758	same weakness as democrats, overall, failing to solve simple problems. 
203770	No morals, willfully misleading people, gerrymandering, stance towards gay people, stance towards people of another race or religion, aggressively working to undue a free and fair election, abortion stance, and standing by a convicted felon. 
203800	I believe that the party has lost its way when it comes to human rights, accepting facts and gun control. Gun ownership is a right, but weapons of war should not be easily available. 
203818	sometimes seems to support big business too much. The greed at the top prevents support of the worker. 
203862	fanatical devotion to Trump[CHAR(10)]position on abortion rights 
203892	overturning of roe vs wade was a horrible backslide for America. 
203904	values aligned with Christian fundamentalism and patriarchal white nationalism 
203928	The Republican Party seems to be interested in taking the country backwards.It seems that there are many radicals and negativity. 
203934	thought that’s what I just wrote 
203999	que esta algo dividido 
204035	Donald Trump 
204041	unwilling to stand up strong enough on key issues 
204077	I ALREADY ANSWERED THAT QUESTION IN THE QUESTION BEFORE 
204130	it’s trump’s party 
204172	I feel that the Republican party has forgotten the separation between Church and State. Religious ideals are influencing government policy. Also, their obsession with maintaining gun rights has turned hysterical. 
204184	fake information, division and hate, not respecting the constitution, assaulting of the Capitol, xenophobia, conspiracy theory makers, Project 2015 creators, truth denial 
204262	i just youthey seem to want to controll rather then sove 
204268	crooks, don't have the good of all American in their interests 
204292	antiquated social views on gender, sex, abortion and religion 
204358	they dont work together with the democrats. bipartisan 
204423	About themselves, not the general public. 
204458	everything, they're monsters. 
204499	Rino's 
204563	Religious right, anti-abortion, and homophobia! 
204592	This insane loyalty to Trump 
204609	for big business not for improving the environment 
204615	abortion stance and trump support 
204788	I'm not always certain that positions promoted to the voters are actually what's happening. 
204824	anti-choice, anti-immigrant, racist, filled with evangelical Christians who want to turn the country into a “Christian nation,” bad for the economy, want to turn back the clock for women’s rights, they hate and want to harm gay and trans and queer people 
204830	they are now the party of Trump, they seem to do anything he says or to please him, they will change possible decisions if Trump does not like them, they are too extreme in conservatism, they favor the wealthy, they are quick to blame but will take credit for any good program even if they voted against it, they have too many outof control and rude members 
204835	not for working people want for rich 
204877	Lack of attention to their jobs and their general support of Donald Trump 
204888	They have lost sight of their riches commodity= the people 
204924	rinos ,republican in name only. 
204990	no backbone for the majority of the party. its all yes men until they have a position and the. they dont do anything of importance 
205062	They are all independent thinkers but sometimes we should be sticking together in votes in congress. 
205158	abortion, women’s reproductive rights 
205170	They are opportunists not caring about the citizens of this country just themselves. 
205188	They're politicians 
205200	They don’t actually care about the people of America, they care about money and greed. 
205218	anti- choice, poor record on environment, controlled by Trump, against regulations on corporations, favor the rich, lie, controlled by Christian nationalist, racist, weird, many are crazy 
205272	I dont believe in their stance on abortion 
205296	they appear to back stab each other 
205321	They believe that if everyone looks out only for themselves, then everyone who deserves to be taken care of will be. 
205363	Their open affiliation with white supremacist groups and their plans to implement Project 2025. Their misogynistic attitude towards women. Their use of mokescreen antisemitism to pass performative legislation that does nothing to protect American Jews against antisemitism. I could go on... 
205375	Unconditional support for Donald Trump 
205405	How they listen to ex president trump & the cruel lies that they use 
205554	I don't like that Republicans have very typical and stereotypical perspectives on issues that I care about. Abortion, gender identity, and labor unions are all things I'm passionate about that they are not (I'm pro-choice, pro-LGBT, pro-unions). 
205589	For the Rich giving all the rich people tax breaks 
205657	they embrace fascism 
205695	Donald Trump and how the entire party has validated his craziness through allowance and hypocrisy. 
205707	They are two faced liars, only looking out for what will benefit them 
205742	Name calling. Negative ads, would like to see a aturity and an elevation to the old days where there was dignity and respect between BOTH parties. Focus on solutions and improvement. Not name calling and mud slinging. It's immature and childish. 
205748	They are so desperate for control they're willing to back a candidate that would make the anti-christ blush. Absolutely spineless. 
205754	Rhino republicans 
205760	
205778	the abborshent stand 
205801	partisanship - unwillingness to compromise 
205820	How can this republican party defend the man who is running for the highest job in the land, who incidentally is a convicted felon among other crimes, be supported at all for any public office 
205832	comservative and there view on individuals having traditional roles 
205844	The Republican party tried to overthrow our own government on 1/6/2020. They have tried every method possible to overturn a free and fair election, having been stopped because of failure to produce any evidence to support their baseless claims. 
205914	They are too slow to do anything. They are not the achine that the democrat party is, but the dems are corrupt. The republicans are more disorganized, and I have ever only seen ONE instance where a republican voluntarily drop out of a race because it was in the best interest of the party... ONE! They side too often with democrat, especially when it comes to raising the debt ceiling. 
205926	The Republican party is not perfect. There needs to be more working together, instead of working against each other. 
206071	conservatives favor religious belief over scientific fact and are absurdly judgmental and out of touch with any actual sort of reality 
206083	its aleays still 49/51 when u look at it all in numbers. 
206156	Education not important 
206285	stand on abortion, the way he presents himself to the public by saying stupid things, the putting down of people of all kinds. 
206326	They need a backbone. 
206385	It is what I said in the last question. I must had read the last time. I got interup 
206445	Aborition stance 
206557	gap between rich and poor getting worse 
206562	they have abandoned their traditional standards and enabled the despicable Trump purely for political expediency. The Republican party has been reinvented as a neo fascist MAGA cult 
206598	They tend to fight among themselves. Do not get anything done. 
206616	They nominated Trump! Trump seems to be in it for himself and not the American people. 
206634	the erosion of respect for our governmental institutions, the extensive use of disinformation and outright lies to further dubious policy decisions via the media, particularly social media. Also, the loss of gentlemanly behavior when encountering members of the opposing party. And the use of scare tactics when attempting to address a serious issue. 
206717	often decisive and undecided 
206733	yes they are radical and don’t speak up for the good of the people. they are self serving 
206745	Trump social issues 
206787	hate that Trump wants to control women, that he corrupted the Supreme Court, and that he blocked the bipartisan border bill 
206793	abortion rights of minorities 
206810	
206822	To many Republicans are weak on policy and don’t stand up to the communists. 
207027	The cutback of governmental programs that many republican candidates suggest that are much needed programs for a country. 
207033	for one, they nominated a candidate who wants to be a dictator. Many of them are exhibiting cult like behaviors by supporting Donald Trump. They are a danger to democracy. They do not support women’s rights or the rights of the LGBTQ plus community is republican party at its way, I truly believe, they would want all Americans to be white and Christian. They do not celebrate diversity whatsoever. 
207089	Dividive policies, generous tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, restrictive abortion legislation, denial of environmental problems, particularly climate change 
207095	
207100	Voting for (immigration) legislation strictly along party lines and not what is in the best interest of the people. 
207124	Policies, leadership, rhetoric 
207154	They only support the wealthy 
207160	abortion rights 
207189	liars and listening to trump 
207209	They are racist and cultlike and follow Trump blindly. They cannot stand up for integrity. 
207221	The lock-step manner in which they follow along with whatever Donald Trump does. 
207238	their approach is party first 
207244	There attempts at voter suppression (such as outrageous gerrymandering).. Their threats to upend NATO and return to some sort of faux isolationism. They're turning their backs on sensible environmental rules and regulations. Giving Big Business interests a pass on tax responsibility. There lack of self-control or the self-policing of the outrageous and uncivil antics of some of their political leaders. 
207261	mainly Donald J Trump and the mega Republicans. They insult my intelligence with their lies that they tell and get people to believe. 
207267	They do whatever Trump wants. They don't stand up for what the Republican party stood for in the past. They' re only for the big corporations not the average Americans. They want to take our rights away from us. 
207290	Their stances on immigration, abortion, and their general lack of decorum as of 2016. 
207320	Certian conservative values do not align with mine. 
207355	They are to conservative on most issues. 
207384	
207448	Bigots mostly using past thought processes to maintain their privilege and mask their racism. people who are greedy and believe their relgious beliefs apply to all and are unable to seperate church and state even from a constitutional standpoint 
207556	there philosophy on economics 
207690	Even eaders in powerful, high positions have prostrated themselves at the alter of a fraudster. I don't vote for someone who is destined to be a follower, continually punked and exploited by an obvious con man. 
207702	Donald J Trump is not a candidate that I can support 
207720	That they support a loose cannon like Trump. 
207738	Their choice in candidates for the election 
207750	exclusionary, divisive, too religious, they seem to block progress 
207762	socially too conservative, uncaring, beholden to Donald Trump, letting Trump dictate things, sticking to the “big lie” that the election was stolen. 
207768	Oddly, I am ok with abortion and single payer healthcare. I wish the republicans would get on board with those issues. 
207801	How they have let Trump have the voice over the entire party. How can one man speak for everyone. 
207813	Lately, more mud-slinging than policy making 
207830	Too hardcore. policies not always right in my minds eye. 
207842	They believe they have the right to control the people of the country. 
207848	racism attitudes[CHAR(10)]criminal activities [CHAR(10)]no concern for the poor[CHAR(10)]pro life [CHAR(10)]economic platforms[CHAR(10)]2025 platform 
207866	The Republican Party is fully beholden to a disgusting human being (Trump) and as they sink further into racism, incompetence, culture wars, and tax cuts for the wealthy, they are bringing the rest of the country down with them. They have no policy plans, no visionary ideas, and no interest in helping the American people. The only things Republicans seem to care about are banning books, controlling women's bodies, bullying marginalized communities, clinging to power for power's sake, elevating the dumbest cranks (like...Amber Rose? Really?), worshipping Trump, and stopping any and all progress in this country. 
207872	how they all supported trump 
207884	they should mind their own business when it comes to abortion they're just a bunch of old men and this is a women's choice not theirs 
207890	The abortion stance 
207914	Viewed as racist or incensitive 
207956	Removing social safety programs. 
208033	At this period in history, everything about it I disagree with. 
208065	a bit chaos in the process 
208090	Abortion access, corruption of supreme court, immigration, general inability to be kind to anyone 
208134	Their complete negativity towards the Democratic Party. 
208152	
208194	taking away women's rights 
208200	I’m trans so there’s that 
208206	insincere, selfish, manipulative, uncooperative 
208248	abortion stance 
208254	Starting with their current nominee and all his cult followers, repeal of Roe v.Wade and the influence of the Christian nationals 
208290	trying to move us back in history 
208302	We don't have a Republican Party (GOP) any longer. The GOP is now the onald J. Trump party. 
208308	Less focus on education 
208342	not keeping church separate and trying to run women’s bodies 
208360	immigration policy 
208366	The “America First” and Project 2025 concepts seem to have taken over the party. I disagree strongly with these concepts. 
208372	Position on abortion, LGBTQ rights, Ukraine and Putin, climate denial 
208390	they have abandoned all principles 
208425	the Republican Party doesn’t exist anymore. It’s just a Trump cult now 
208431	Not a strong track record in terms of supporting public education (too many benefits for private schools and voucher programs). I don't believe the government should tell a woman she can't have an abortion 
208443	stance on lgbtq, abortion, immigration, and tariffs 
208461	Led by Trump, do not approve of his rhetoric, lying, fraud misinterpretation of statistics. 
208491	they are in Aptos supporting each other within the party. Are you go after the Democrats and the Democrats are doing obvious wrongdoings by changing the voting practices during the 2020 election because of Covid, etc. They are just not a cohesive teamIt comes to making critical decisions take the example of trying to find a speaker of the house how many times did you have to vote for speaker to get one or no? commentary they need to go out the Democrats when the Democrats you pull stunts that should not be in the political process. 
208503	Too quick to help corporate and wealthy citizens. 
208570	The republicans are trying to take away a lot from America. If they get in office it’s going to be complete chaos. 
208599	I blame them for the overturning of Roe. They are also complicit in allowing Trump to make a mockery of our country. 
208765	won’t legalize or decriminalize marijuana on a federal level 
208811	Self interests over the benefit of all 
208829	they trying to get rid of the middle class and women rights 
208859	It supports and elevates the voices of those on the conservative fringes that should not be government today. 
208883	everything- give me a republican like a John McCain. 
208901	Wrong leadership in that party 
208907	to many are against the constitution 
208919	unity and lack of being able to get things done 
208943	They support big business. The middle class is paying for everything. I don’t like their stance on abortion. 
208963	I don't like the way they see Donald Trump. How can they support someone who doesn't tell the truth. 
208980	Their continued support of Donald Trump. 
208992	They want policies that support the very wealthy. They are more concerned with the bottom line than they are people. They appear to want to take us back to the 1950's way of living. Some of their extreme member make ridiculous claims that aren't founded on facts. They want us to be a theocracy and not a democracy. I believe in the separation of church and state. 
209010	Their stance on women's rights, the fact they favor big business over middle class, lack of empathy for the poor or anyone that is different, the fact that of all the possible candidates that they could endorse they choose Donald Trump. 
209016	many seem to be far right, have no idea how the American people live and have no connection with, and seem to have exstream views and want to talk without listening 
209076	Immigration, Women's rights and they are for the rich 
209082	Spending. Lack of follow through on congerssional talking points. 
209088	It disregards human rights, justice, and women’s rights. 
209287	too focused on religion. 
209293	their servitude to Trump 
209316	the Republican party used to be a haven where Nazis and KKK and other terrible people would hide out. now, though, those folks are out in the open in the party. 
209322	many Republicans are claiming the 2020 election was stolen from Trump yet there is no evidence of that. 
209328	its modern tendency to appeal to the lowest common denominator of society 
209340	i think i just answered that. hypocritical, racist, anti immigrants, anti lgbtq, don't care about children dying at school, living in extramarital poverty, having good healthcare, etc. 
209370	they are pupit on a stringthey onlydo what trump want 
209382	there are still flaws in the characteristics of people in this party. 
209394	They allowed Donald Trump to run for office. 
209508	women’s rights [CHAR(10)] 
209531	The way they kiss up to Trump I wonder why, I wonder if it’s because Trump has some bad secrets about each and everyone of them OR just that they all know that he is the head of the Kkk since he was next in line after his father 
209555	Failure to do anything lately. Only worried about things that make no sense to me. Book bannings, womans rights to there own bodies,forcing religion on schools 
209621	The politicians who ran as a republican but are not conservative. 
209700	They have jettisoned anything good about their party to win. They have forgotten who they are and what they stand for in their support of Donald Trump 
209736	taxes. immigration 
209806	Donald Trump is the face of the Republican Party and they follow him in tow and anything he says is word of law. He is a danger and if the Republican party can pull it back after he leaves, maybe I will come back to them. 
209864	they are liers and they follow a lier. they make up lies 
209893	Deficit spending, support of Trump, abortion stance, gay marriage 
209899	They fear monger. The House hasn't done anything this entire term. 
209969	They still argue within the party and do not cooperate enough 
210033	THEY think the world is there for the taken...and nobody else matters. 
210045	I hate everything that brings trump 
210063	Supreme Court;reproductive rights; lack of gun control restrictions;racial equality; taxes for the 1% 
210080	taking abortion rights away 
210105	They normally favorite the wealthy 
210111	only want MORE MONEY 
210117	
210135	has become the party that does what Donald Trump wants rather than a party that is interested in governing and finding middle ground. Too interested in serving the interests of the extremely wealthy at the cost of the middle and lower classes. wrong-headed views on gun control. elevating people to positions of power that espouse Christian nationalist views 
210153	Most of them are for Donald Trump 
210159	their stand on abortion, don’t care about middle & lower income Americans [CHAR(10)]their stand on climate change 
210165	antiabortion 
210177	They have allowed Donald Trump to stop the bipartisan bill to help tighten the southern border. Then complain that nothing has been done for the border!! That is just what example of their bowing down to Donald Trump. 
210183	their view of women, abortion, tax cuts for rich, decreasing Medicare/medicaid 
210201	stand against everything I believe 
210219	The party has gotten way out of hand. It used to be the ommon sense party I grew up with but I don't recognize it any more. It's gotten to the point of focusing more on stripping away all the rights we fought hard for through the years. Also, concentrating on conspiracy theories and mud-slinging instead of moving forward to actually work for us and help solve problems in a bi-partisan way. It came to a head with Trump and his wannabe's. 
210225	poor representation, too far right 
210231	trump[CHAR(10)]anti abortion 
210237	wish they were more strict on abortion 
210249	not taxing the rich, anti abortion 
210261	That there doesn’t seem to be any moderate, intelligent republicans anymore. 
210267	THIS IS NOT THE REPUPLICAN PARTY. It is the trump party. 
210285	when they have an opportunity to change things they fail. reducing the deficit! 
210297	abortion policies should be political 
210303	The candidate for President is not someone to be proud of. His thinking changed when he lost the last election. He is for Donald Trump. He is too friendly with Russia! He is proud that Roe vs Wade was over turned. He only wants people that think his way, to be part of his life. He is happy to fire Union workers that go on strike for better living wages. In the last 4 years, he has made me not proud to be a Republican. 
210387	I am a supporter of a progressive/adaptable approach to politics; I think that a conservative approach to legislation (preserving longstanding rules/regulations/perspectives) is unproductive and doesn't match nor meet the needs of a developing population. In general, I have found that my political views tend to support and uplift the rights/wellbeing of the collective while providing room for the rights/wellbeing of the individual, as opposed to the other way around. I do not agree with the Republican Party's stance on gun control, restricting abortion access, nor their prioritization on a privately-dominated economy with loose restrictions on monopolization. 
210405	Bad progression in social politics 
210544	Not addressing worsening income inequality, influenced by money from corporations, increasingly accepting of racism. Not loving or understanding of others. 
210608	The people are the foundation of our government. we have lost this due to the I am better than you attitude from the Republican party. we are all the people, everyone needs help sometimes. 
210614	Radical conspiracy theories. 
210650	abortion policies tax policies immigration policies 
210734	Some times there ideas on foreign affairs, which in my eyes is very important for the entire world not just our great country! 
210741	standing by Trump, having bad values for abortion and womens rights and DEI and immigration and healthcare and prison reform 
210759	they let Trump control them when he should not be involved 
210783	Their loyalty to Trump and Project 2025. 
210789	women’s health care right to choose 
210860	not enough diversity 
210913	I really don’t like in general that the Republican Party likes to restrict the right of people from varying backgrounds. We should embrace our nation’s diversity and let people live freely when it comes to their choice of who they live, their reproductive freedoms, etc. 
211030	Their extremist agenda 
211099	Only a few republicans seem willing to do their jobs. The majority of them are into grievance politics by wasting too much money on the Biden investigation aka impeachment inquiry which went no where. The big lie about election fraud and the not wanting to investigate Jan. 6 congressional involvement shows they were not interested in investigating the truth. Not passing the border bill because trump said no! And the whole speaker debacle was an embarrassment. Trump is an embarrassment. 
211105	they absolutely will not vote for anyone or any ideas for better if it doesn't come from the Republican party. they fight more against democracy than to work with democracy 
211111	Donald Trump andvance 
211123	Always for the rich and strongly against Unions. 
211128	Authoritarian policies, want to control people that aren't like them. Very weak on actual policy. Anti woman, immigration, economic policies that only help the wealthy. Weak on climate change. 
211134	That many don't think for themselves. They listen to one guy - the one who won't accept defeat in 2020 and firmly suggests his people to break into our nation's capitol. 
211140	In general....they don't care about what is in the best interest of all the people. They lack integrity. They supported a candidate because of political affiliation even though he is obviously incompetent. He made a mockery of the highest position in the country.

Most of them base themselves off of Christianity and use it in arguements, but only when it suits their wants. I.E. abortion, gay marrige, ect.

211336	They are making some bad choices for the middle class people on their agenda. They are supporting someone they know is bad for our country. 
211383	The party of greed. Corporate greed - the rich get richer. The new Republican Party over the recent years has become the party of insanity. They have normalized the crazies, and the white nationalists, and hate.

211656	racism, homophobia & not supporting workers 
211662	it’s a cult following 
211673	Neo-liberalism was an obvious failure, and the Republican Party isn’t able to reconcile that reality with their stated beliefs, so they haven’t had any new ideas since Reagan.

212504	It is not a arty anymore. It is a Donald Trump cult. They have all sold their souls to a cult leader. We live in a democracy in the United States not a new fangled version of Hitler's Nazi Germany. Do I believe that Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or Tim Walz are perfect? No. But I also believe that they will not be a dictator or take anymore rights away from the American people. It sickens me that so many lives were lost during covid that didn't need to happen because an incompetent President was in the white house at the time. It sickens me that my mother had more rights over her own body in 1975 than women do today. We are supposed to be moving forward not backward. I wasn't alive in the 1950's and I do not want to live in whatever fantasized version of the '50's that the republicans have in store from their cult leader. And make no mistake, I do not believe that Donald Trump is alone in this. He is not mentally capable of dreaming this up all by himself. It is their desperate last ditch effort to cling to power.

Hearings have shown that too many simply dont even understand how women's bodies actually work, and have made decisions that take away the ability to make life saving medical decisions. 
213666	Generally - key word: generally - Republicans tend to favor racist, sexist and homophobic policies. Tend to let beliefs outweigh facts, tend to not trust experts or science (and yet they would be back in the Stone Age without them), tend to believe that corporations should face less and less regulations despite countless examples of how that policy ends terribly - but since they tend to be composed of white people of privilege, they can escape those consequences by buying their way into a protective insulating bubble. Republican politicians and public figures tend to cloak themselves in false patriotism and religion and yet how many of them have crashed and burned due to scandals and exposed hypocrisy? Their current loyalty to Trump further cements their moral emptiness.

221792	The people who subscribe to the party. It's rare for me to hear anyone say they're a Democrat but the Republicans will tell you before you know their name. Maybe in a different time they were better, but as it is now the Republican party is rotten. The Democrats are incompetent.

222460	They aligned with Donald Trump too early in the election process. 
222466	(1) Hypocrisy (2) Claiming to be against immigration while working with businesses to bring in foreign labor to suppress domestic salaries and wages (3) Claiming to be fiscal conservatives while supporting foreign aid (4) Claiming to defend Christian values while working with Zionists to end freedom of assembly, religion, and speech (5) Claiming to defend America from its enemies while directly antagonizing foreign nuclear powers

223812	I meant no. Don't know how to go back. 
223890	Their incessant need to take this country to a theocratic government when we were founded on religious freedom. Additionally, I don’t mind older ideologies of the republican party but the introduction of “MAGA” into the party has brought them so far from “fiscal conservatism” that they no longer stand for their own political ideologies. 
223985	greed. they like to take a away a lot of benefits like health care and so on. 
224056	Disrespect of the black race in general 
224079	too reliant on the Bible for moral oversight 
224174	Abortion and birth control laws are outrageous.

224340	Republicans oppose government regulations. I think the goverment should be regulated. 
224416	We were registered Republicans until 2008 and MAGA has now hijacked the party. They are embracing Christian Nationalism and appear to be worshipping Donald Trump. It is un-American to ban books and strip rights away from minority populations both racially and sexual orientation. They are anti-abortion which is health care and dangerous. Project 25. 
224422	The party has lost its direction under Donald Trump. They are presenting political issues to the public more like a reality show than addressing real concerns

224882	They are only interested in themselves. They don't represent the will of the people. 
224906	I'm going to answer the same for BOTH parties. I do not like the divide and agitation that has occurred in our country over politics. I can understand difference in opinions on policies and ways of governing. I cannot understand or agree with this emotional upheaval over likes & dislikes of our candidate's personalities. It's become a personality contest. On social media or even the news, I don't often hear about the policies being discussed and how they will affect our country for good or bad. I hear more about the dogs and cats being eaten in Springfield or about Kamala's laugh or her accents. I don't vote based on someone's personality, I vote on the policy proposals and whether or not they will change our country for good. My concern is how people will react after the election no matter who gets voted in. 
224959	They don't want to work with the democrats and cross the aisle to get things done

Removing politicians who did not kneel to the cult of Trump. it is not a political party anymore. It is a cult. I was raised in a conservative household. It is disgusting what Trump has done to the GOP. We need two strong, viable political parties. The GOP is just appalling right now. I hope they can rebuild when they get rid of Trump. 
234737	racism, removing human rights from historically marginalized groups, dereuglating industry, poor public health policies 
234749	basically everything else. I don’t agree with almost all their policies. they are created with only an individual in mind and not a community of diverse incomes, backgrounds, experiences, good and bad fortune. it is a very egocentric outlook 
234761	I feel over the years the party has lost integrity. They have insulted people in the military, protected the wealthy and have given their back to the working class.

They Do Not care about anything but gaining power and keeping power. 
234989	too deeply seated in religion when making decisions on American rights 
235133	They are very aggressive and racist towards the opposite parties. They make very unnecessary comments towards the POC groups. Since they are mostly pro lifers, they decide to go harass people at abortion clinics. 
235139	They are a group that is becoming too heavily associated with extremist, anti-American, anti-freedom ideology. Republican beliefs can be extremely agreeable when you do not have hate speech being spewed so loud you can not hear those agreeable beliefs. ake America Great Again is an ideology that has become associated with this party, and is simply a vessel for hateful bigots to rally under a atriotic banner, making their racism, homophobia, and hate ustified simply because they're labeling everything they hate as anti-American and anti-Patriotic. Hating others because of the color of their skin, who they choose to love, or how they choose to identify is an extremely dangerous, toxic, and terrifying belief that, sadly, Republicans have become heavily associated with.

235377	I don't like how the majority of Republicans go along with and defend everything Donald Trump says and does, regardless of the whether his words or actions are obviously lies, unlawful or unethical. 
235441	abortion rights 
235459	I loathe that the Republican Party has become so Intertwined with religion.

235789	Book banning, trying to dismantle education, constant tax cuts for Billionaires, their blatant Racism and Sexism and Bigotry, trying to control women's reproductive rights and choices, their blatant ignorning of Trump's treason on Jan 6, trying to restrict voting rights, their ignoring climate change 
235800	Donald Trump is a Republican. JD Vance is a Republican. The Republican leaders only care about power. No matter how bad their candidate for President is and they know this they will still back him. As leaders of this country, they should care about the people not the party name. Take Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and many others. They will back Donald Trump even though they do not like him. 
235812	their policies…reducing the middle class to some low level… no health benefits, abortion rights, voting rights,[CHAR(10)]they cheat , scare people at the voting booths, crazy politics on immigration

236126	need to drop the maga movement 
236149	Belief that personal wealth is more important than the well being of the country. the theory of trickle down economics that makes the rich richer and poor poorer. The belief that a woman’s body and health are government business. Disregard for the environment in favor of making more money. The general conservative perspective that owning guns is an individual right guaranteed by the 2nd amendment and that there is no need state or federal regulations for licensing or background checks or restrictions on automatic weapons. These are the same people who feel that the federal or state government should decide how a woman deals with a pregnancy. The evangelical Christian leaning or pretend belief in Christian teachings associated with the party. I think politicians hide behind their religious beliefs which should not be associated with government. I believe consenting adults should be able to love and marry whoever they wish. In general I think the Republican Party disagrees with that theory.

They will take a district that is primarily even, blacks and whites, democrats and republicans, and try to reorganize that district to where it's mostly Republicans. They're famous for that. /AO/ no 
326526	Their predelection toward fascist and white supremacist policies. /AE/ No. 
326535	they favor upper class, they don't try to help lower class or middle class at all, but neither do the Democrats so /AE/ that's it

326797	extreme right, use of religion, tie b/w religion and govt/ 
326812	I don't think the Republican party is for the working man, the common man, I also don't think the Republican party will stand up to Trump like they should /AE/ no

326928	Donald trump representing that party currently/ae/ no 
327292	Everything. Total lack of credibility. overcoming democracy, The pathological support of Donald Trump. Failing to take a stand against the people who attacked our capital. Devisiveness. 
327329	I would say some of the views on, I guess I've heard a lot about making the rich richer and I don't like that, I feel everybody should be treated equally and everybody the opportunity that deserves it/ae/no 
327381	religio in schools,

327609	It has become a trumpcult /ao/ if the republicans it used to be that when someone was voting rep it had certain meaning of convertism in a good sense and that is no longer there the same way /ao/no 
327799	they repsresent in my opinont th wealthy and i believe they are racists and i dont think they are concern about the issues of woman/ao/no 
327856	The paris agreement, they are backing out of that. 
327994	Donald Trump. 
328123	Some of them, not all but some, tend to flip flop on their values. they dont fight as hard for their cause at the dems do for theirs 
328163	women's rights / ae / no 
328240	they have too much of an agenda about womens rights; this should not be in plitics but up to a women herself; the divisiveness they have against the democratic party, laws and bils don't get pased just to be apposing; seems they don't have anyting to stand on, ita always them decising it the plar opposite of what the democrati pasrty is asking or wanting to do; having them be a part of nominating Donals Trump know his history and what kind of person he is, and allowing his to be their respresentative is very questionable of their motives; 
328450	mixing religion and their party taking a woman's rights away, IFV, abortion /ao/ nah 
328506	That they don't stand together. /AE/ No. 
328537	don't like their stand on abortion 
328683	I think it coincides with our 2nd ammendment rights, I don't think they are as strict on them as they could be. I feel that we could have more reforms. /AE/ I would like to see a different candidate for president than Donald Trump, I think there must be several options out there that would be better. /AE/NO 
328812	I think i have covered that already, not the new ones. It makes it hard to get anything done because the old establishment Republicans have started voting with the Democrats. /AO/ No 
328824	some candidates 
328904	they are richer, they use it more towards them and not us they dont care about the middle class or the poor 
329059	I don't think they have handled foreign policy well. I also don't like how much lobbying they do. 
329136	some are corupt/no 
329404	Republicans they more on not doing the right thing and that aint right, you know. They more,, I guess you say if you low class you aint really nothing to them and thats just wrong. ao/no 
329522	basically I would have to say everything at this point, their goal is to divide and that's just not, oh and their spineless, almost forgot that one, their afraid to stand up to their leader /AE/ no

329726	their candidate ae no 
329827	Their policies, their candidate/ae/saving money for billionaires/ae/no 
329893	Well right now i just feel like both parties, honestly, I feel like both parties are corrupt. Both parties when they are running say that they are going to do these things to help the people but they don't do it. They don't help the people. I guess I just feel like they are corrupt on both sides anymore. /AO/ No 
329896	I don't like that they don't try to meet in the middle on major events, they seem to forget about the people they represent// ao//that is all 
330021	don't like that they twist things think they're extemly hypocritical are only intered n serving peole who are ike them and not ll people ae/ no thats a good summary 
330071	they always have these uh for um they seem to cater to a certain demographic of citizens /AE/ that's it 
330139	I don't like their stand on abortion. /AE/ Not thrilled with handling of the supremem court. /AE/ That's pretty much it. 
330186	Their cultural fixations, their kind of vaguely white supremasist and christian nationalism leanings, their religious ferver, their distrust of others outside the party, and their now facist leanings. /ae/ 
330331	Stance on abortion, its a woman's body her decision what to do with it. Has a daughter and he'd be irritated if she was raped and pregnant and can't get rid of the child she doesn't wanter, didin't plan for. The one thing he doesn't like. Its no ones, no man's right to do with her body /AE/ No

330360	They seem to only care for the wealthy people /AE/ Their leader is very disrespectful /AE/ It's leaders are rude /AE/ No

330469	The attachment to Trump 
330587	i think they are not inclusive, esp on social issues, i think their foreign and economic policys are significantlt worse than democrats 
330648	Cuando que no apoyen a su presidente en cosas posiritvas para su nacion; 
330767	I find them dishonest, they use dishonest tactics to paint the liberal democratic side as more extreme than it is. I do not like that they continue to use certain talking points um, as major to dividde the american public on gender, sexuality, race, patriotism, the meaning of patriotism. I cant think of what else. I think they play politics quite heavily for instance when they stopped the bipartisian border bill. I think they are disengenious in their support for donald trump. I think they overspeak to traditional values that can be harmful to non traditional ways of life. um, yep, and I think there are economic policies that are harmful to the american public. /AE/ no 
330824	Racism, critizism, lack of understanding, lack of abilty to adapt to community, lack of understanding of individuals and their individual freedoms/ae/no 
330896	their immigrant policy/ae/they are not doing their job/ae/their choice for runniing trump/ae/no 
330993	their womens rights. 
330996	they are weak. some are/ae/no 
331168	their stance on aboration their stance on gay marriage 
331180	Some of the party members. To many Rhinos, Republican in name onlys. /AO/ No 
331265	I guess how they handle social affairs. /AE/ Nothing is coming to mind. 
331304	the everything against the lower class, always looking to the golden boys, the group of people who have been for themselves, the aspect of the religions when mixing religions with politics, abortion, birth control, making viagra but women can't get birth control /ae/ that's it 
331565	Just their, issue with reproductive rights. /AE/ Nah I think that's the big issue, let everyone have their choice. 
331714	Everything. I can't think of a thing that I like about the republican party. 
331869	i just dont like how its very conservative/ao/ thats it 
332094	i don't think they stand for the worker, they stand for the businesses but don't share to the people doing the jobs, the rich get richer, 
332272	abortion, they say they want small govt, they say one thing and do another , tax policy, I don't like that they are anti worker, but pro business, they also refuse to raise the minimum wage/ae/no 
332433	immigration policies, abortion rights, decisions based on religion, tax policies for billionaires, 
332912	I dont like the swin toward right wing extermism, I dont like the bullying, and I disagree most of their policy positions at this time/ae/ no 
332958	No Regan /AE/ No 
333314	lack of leadership, no thats enough 
333335	how some things are black and white when it comes to immigation and women's health i don't necessarily agree with those stances 
333344	Some of the hypocracy and delussion and affinity for conspiracy. /AE/NO 
333458	THey are unwilling to work with the democrats towards helping working class people survive.A/Eno 
333687	The old guard I think is absolute garbage. People like Lindsay Graham and Mitch McConnell, you know like the leadership are will certain companies, certain business advantages, It's just croneyism. I think the older part of the Republican party is just as for sale as the older part of the Democratic party. I don't specifically feel that way about Trump though. He's made his money and through all the interviews I've listened to with him I don't think that he's trying to enrich himself as his main focus. He has lost money, I think since he has started running in 2015. I do think that it's interesting that an old man has opened things up for the younger Republicans to change things. It's a very curious case considering he is a life long New York Democrat. /AO/ NO 
333718	I don't like that I feel that a lot of people are dishonest. A lot of the personell are out for their own agenda. 
333756	The new generation of young school graduates, high school and college, are not going to vote for them. They have 12 years of children that they would not protect in schools. You can't make children hide under their desks 5 times a year, scared, and think that they will vote for you. They not only had them hide under their desks, they would have to imagine what they would do if they died./ae/They've comited themselves to single issue voters. I think it is a dangerous ploy/ae/no 
333773	We area adversarial, 
333861	there too extreme/ao/no 
334064	all the non truths/ao/no 
334153	sometimes they don't agree between themselves 
334591	The Republican party is all about detroying government for billionaires and corporations. They don't want to govern. They are just like an on-line troll factory. I think I disagree with every one of their positions. 
334700	i feel like they are more aout the wealthy, theyre more for the wealthy /ao/ thats it. 
334801	I feel like they could be mire united/AE/no 
334823	They are too extreme. They've lost their way. 
334906	they feel very extreme to me/ao/there are a lot of labels attached to the party that dont put the us in a very good light/ao/racist, exclustionalry, zenaforbic/ao/i dont agree with views on womens heaalth/ao/ive heard that they are trying to do away with no fault divorce and other things along thatline and i dont agree with that either/ao/no 
335043	a lot of classism very elite group of ppl feels like they are looking out for a certain type of ppl not inclusive at all 
335208	I don't like what they've become. So many of them seem to lack a moral compass. JD Vance called Trump America's Hitler and now he's his running mate. Lindsay Graham gave an impassioned speach after January 6th, or maybe it was on January 6th. And, now you wouldn't even know it. /AE/ No 
335388	They can seem very cold and unwilling to help people in need. A/E No 
335445	unfavorable tax policies from middle to lower income american, immigration policy, abortion and rights for women 
335760	They are not serious about standing for the ideas that they espouse. For instance, anyone who has paid attention to politics in the last few years would know Joe Biden is not cognitively capable of leading our country, yet there is little to nothing - let me rephrase - there is little to no action taken to remove him; I understand that a move in Congress by the Republicans to enact the 25th Amendment probably would not work because of the numbers we have on the Republican side, however there has not een been an attempt, which is distressing to say the least. I'm ready to go. 
335830	I dont like their stance on abortion, litmis test to be religious to be a memeber of the party, and I dont like the race baiting that came with the past administration/AO// 
335946	Their stance on women's rights and LGBTQ issues/ae/no 
336173	Their inablity to lead. They are worthless/ae/no 
336184	Their trend toward autocracy, their race-baiting, their cultural disparagements, ummm, their abandonment of the former Republican status or position, their denigration of the military and their lying about everything. 
336218	most everything else /ao/ no 
336278	It comes down to who's representing them. I just feel like there is such a range of beliefs in either party it just comes down to the individual for me. /AO/ No 
336325	they don't fight like democrats. the democrats are mean fighters. Sometimes their not a cohesive group 
336525	their xenophobia as well as there was something I was going to say, I forget now, I guess the extreme conservatism /AE/ no 
336728	Their worship of donald trump and their lack of any mmorals or true policies today, I don't like their nationalisim to the point of bordering on what you would call facisim.A/E 
336818	It has, it's gotten extream in the opposit way of the democratic party, we should all meet in the middle somehow//ao// there is a lot that I don't like but there is less that I don't like with the republican party than the democratic party//ao// no, I think that pretty well covers it 
336826	Their hard stance against social issues, their inability to separate church from state. /AE/ No that's good. 
336978	Almost everything, dishonesty, manipulation those are the two main ones /AE/ The people /AE/ That covers most of it 
337094	They are politicians/ae/no 
337374	i think that they should fucos on America and stop existing in a bubble it is unrealistic, for any one country to be 100% self relinant, we need our allies as much as our allies need us 
337421	Stances on immigration /AE/ Presidents have often been war hungry /AE/ No 
338080	yea i dont like their extremism , and how much they lean on religion and that religion goes into the policies. 
338097	they all over the place 
338238	They're running for a government they don't believe in, don't beileve in government, I don't appreciate that they have been for over 50 years favoring big bunsiess and wealthy coorpationns and people at the expense at the rest of us, fair amount of evidence of corruption, payoff lobbiests for their votes /AE/ No 
338347	herd voting, supporting a presidential candidate they previously said they would not support/ae/ deciding On not passing legislation because of a President candidates opinion/ae/ being hipocrits related to open Supreme court seats/ae/ sharing or sharing of conspiracy theories as facts 
338419	Stances on religion and health care/ae/no 
338430	the fact they dont agree with gov. Assistance like food samps/ae/ and they want to do away with abortion/ae/no 
338533	The same thing as with the democrats, I don't believe they can really do what they say they can do. I don't really like some of the stances they take with women's issues, partucularly abortion. They seem very untrustworthy, more so than the democratic party, and they seem more willing to play dirty with what they use in their ads and shit. I don't really pay attention to them anymore but that was the vibe I got previously. 
338599	I just don't like what they stand for. 
338645	they are rich 
338843	Too exclusive. 
338934	they stormed the capital 
338937	the propaganda, hatred, division 
338939	Ever since donald trump has been in the situation, hes been greatly deceitful . The whole party runs on this . 
338976	Polarizing, not open-minded, discriminatory, too mature, stubborn, can be colonial at times in the decision making. /ae/ Social work and social causes are not prioritized. /ae/ More outcome focused without keeping in mind human rights and well-being. /ae/ No. 
339072	How much it's became a uniparty for the politically elite of the neo conservative movement /AE/ Not that I could think of 
339168	IDK about them telling the truth all the time. 
339331	Overspend/ae/no 
339452	They are close minded, unflexible. A/E no 
339478	the hard right, ultra conservatives /AE/ their stance on abortion /AE/ intolerance /AE/ no that'll do it 
339480	I don't feel anything is being done for the middle class /AE/ that's all 
339506	their morals /ae/their policies/ 
339808	Their ability to push religion into their political policies. /AE/ No. 
340121	It's influx so it's hard to know broadly. They have historically been too conservative socially. Not always geared for lower class workers and typically hawkish on war. /AE/No. 
340249	i dont like their stance on womans reproduction health and separation of state and their gun control isislike their stance on homesextual marriage and trans gender health and their stanxce on education in general/ao/no 
340828	they are backing trump with such minless aboned 
340910	many extremists who refuse to work with the conserviateive R and Democrats to make necessary changes for American people, the extremists are more concerned with personal interests than doing what is good for American people /ao/ no 
341119	attitude/ae/i think they are just full of hot air, saying what the people want them to say not neccarily do what they say/ae/just dont like them, personality ways arrogant/ae/no 
341414	i think they could be a little more understanding and workwith the Democratics instead of trying to make everything go they way they want 
341524	I don't like their stance on abortion. I don't like immigration policy. I don't international relations, I don't like the America first slogan. I don't like that they supported Donald Trump as a candidate. /ae/I don't like that the way that they have handled things with the Supreme Court. I don't like their stance on same sex marriage. /ae/ that's it. 
341604	theyre too conservative and elitist 
341749	I DONT LIKE WHEN THEY ARE TRYINF TO SIGN THINGS IN ON A BACK DEAL/AO/NO 
341784	I don't like their stance on funding the military, education. I don't like their social values and I don't like how they want to put social care in the state's hands and I don't like their christian values. /ae/ Not that I can think of. 
341846	using conservative christians in the wrong way. Their educatin policies. Their funding for some needful people. 
341865	the fact that they can't find a better candidate for president. Obviously I lean republican even though im a registered independent, maybe there's a lack of diversity in th party. AE those are the main things 
341916	they are too old, needs to be younger people in there to do things that what they got going on. /ao/ 
342160	La imposicion a las mujeres del aborto no me gusta /AE/ No principalmente esa, no 
342163	Dishonesty, back door dealings, smear campaigns for anyone that doesn't agree with them /AE/ No 
342520	they are biotry, they only have select races. they want to change people of color to change their thought of being of color based on their financial status//ao// they don't give amerca a chance to be americans again//ao/ 
342539	they could be more unified, 
342690	extremeism, divisness, patriorchy, Christian nationalism, 
342720	i think theres going to be something you don't like about any party. everything. i seems to me we had a I think there were some people i didn't like, but i can't think of anything. There's always going to be something about somebody you like or agree with 
342766	The rich are still rich, and the poor are the same, AE NO

343215	I feel like they are for the rich AE 
343223	I don't like the fact that they are trying to take away a womans right to choose. /AO/ no 
343288	Their emphais on culture war issues. Their unyeilding support for Donald Trump. 
343512	too many are election deniers, too many follow Trump, 
343797	they are winnies, no back bone, they want to be popular and dont stick to what they promise people. 
343884	The racism that I hear, unaccepting of peoples' differences. 
343894	they[ve been very strategic in turning an unequal distribution of votes into national power, they're policies are very close to the Nazi party, their stance ion immigration is terrible, I'm in favor of more open immigration, they tiypically favor trickle down ecomomic policies which have been shown not to work, they diliberately are against transgender children in opposition to science, consensus, public discovery. Theres a lot of issues, where if you take the problem at face value and then look at the schientific solutions to the problem they are opposed to those solutions. 
343910	It's not a unified party for our country /ae/ I don't like the fact that it makes citizens conform to one standard or another, that they're supposed to represnt us and we're not supposed to represent them /ae/ I will leave it at that 
343932	tax Policy and general Policies related to coporate power and social welfare Policies, general demeanor/ae/corporate interestred control the ways they vote. abadoning the working class. Misinformation thru large broadcasting companies/ae 
343994	not working in the best interest of the American people /AE/ that's good enough 
344010	I do not like a lot of their views about how do I say this, gender rights, sexual rights, they also in my opinion seem to fearmonger a little bit and I'm not a big fan of that. I believe the people should get the facts without bias and without intimidation. /AE/ I think that's it. 
344207	They can make bad policies sometimes. People thats been in politcis a long time just like the democratic they get corrupt./AO/ No 
344251	I THINKit remains a party that doesnt recongize the divesry of ppl in this country, that it doesnt recongize that we are all equal in this country/ it is a whte demonite party/ ae white male demonanted party/ae no 
344295	A lot of it is current, but I think the fact that it continues to support Trump is strange to me. A lot of this is also history. I think there are certain social programs that ought to exist and don't exist because of their stance on government responsibility. /ae/ They don't give me hope. /ae/ No. 
344307	They do not stand by each other. /AE/ no 
344332	they've become very divisive /ao/ doesn't feel like conservitism anymore /ao/ no 
344488	I would say feeling of party loyalty regardless of the wrongdoings of certain officials/ao/no 
344859	Donald Trump is running for president on the republican ticket. Appears they are completely prolife with no exceptions even if the mothers life is in jeopardy. 
344977	i dont like their decent into fasism their belifs in feelty and embrace of their no minee and their cult leader they want to overturn rights and the cycle keeps repeatiing and the people in their party are horribl;e and do not care abouyt the people their are alot of things i do not like about them/ao/um thats it 
345194	I don't like extremes or all or nothing thinking and I feel like sometimes both parties focus too much on extremes when sometimes there can be a middle ground. /AO/ No 
345337	Fear mongering. I'll get messages and tiktoks from my dad about some trans person three states over who doesn't exist. Directing anger towards immigrant by saying they're shoveling fentanyl over the border. I feel like they take real problem like mental health issues and instead of pointing the finger at real problem they point the finger instead at marginalized groups of people. /AE/ There's some pretty overt racism and sexism that makes it funny to watch but also sickening because people ingest that. /AE/ No, I'll get off my soap box. 
345364	The republican party in my experience is every man for themselves. There's no compassion. To me Republican is narcississtic. /AE/ No. 
345378	when they go extreme right - i think that's a problem in the country, we should meet in the middle. If we had a candidate like that would meet in the middle, I would be 100% behind that person. /ae/no 
345550	Controls by old rich men. a/e No 
345578	disregard for minority veiws 
345802	the way that the Republican Party has entrenched in support for Donald Trump and that far right viewpoint, that people who the way in which (just trying to think of how to summarize this) when there's a looking backward in the Republican party to a time that was supposedly better which is a myth, even for the people that it was supposedly better for, appears to be a belief that rights for others come at a cost of rights for themselves, there's a limit on who can have rights so there is kindof a competition/ae/ that summs it up 
345806	sometimes I don't like that when things get rough, and democrats threaten to shut down gov't for example, the Republicans tend to cave. /ao/ I wish some of them would have more backbone. /ao/ that's all. 
345831	Ueven taxation./AE/ Government overreach./AE/NO 
345922	Unwillingness to compromise, putting Trump or themselves over the country. Entertainment over policy. /AE/ Angry /AE/ No 
346005	They've gone off center. And there's yeah, okay. /AE/ Well, the money that's being thrown into the party to support trump, by people who are looking for their own agendas to be met. /AE/ Mm-mm. 
346089	Their unwavering ability to spin everything that any deocrat does, and turn it into something completely negative and personal attack. When given the option of having an intelligent conversation based on facts, they will go on an attack of the person instad of attacking their policy. Marjorie Taylor Greene? Don't get it, don't understand. And I lived in georgia for a while, still don't get it. /AE/ Yes, their current indoctination of a election fraud backup, whenever they lose. Like if I don't win it's gotta be rigged. /AE/ No that's probably it. 
346116	everything 
346251	I guess just the oposite of all the things i just said abut the democratic party if thats fair/AO// 
346443	their attitude toward women, cultivate Christian nationalism where it's a mish mash between Church and state, not separtated anymore. /ao/ their stance on abortion, their anti-abortion stance even against abortion in case of rape and incest, health of mother. Support for charter schools /ao/ that's enough. 
346515	their policy /ao/ that they only care about themselves /ao/ nope 
346628	I don't like how they cut social programs. /ae/ I don't like how they believe helping the american people through social programs is labeled socialism.

346786	The disrespect of the general population AE 
346848	 They are very ignorant. In a push for people to be independent they completely abandon their citizens. 
346911	tax cuts for the wealthy, idea of small government trying to eliminate the bureacracy that has the intelligence training and expertise to handle the weather, trying to shrink the govrnment any leader needs to have intelligent expert people in these areas/tm/I dont think that joe schmoe can handle environmental issues without help from educated expert people we need a bureaue of people, we need NOAH, we need a dept of ed, we need health and human services, and a whole bunch more I dont know like cyber security/ae/ I picture them being more intersted in the people who have money, have businesses and not the people who work/ae not inclusive and for the last several cycles have been projecting a very neg idea of what our society is instead of working at what it could be/ae/fox news/ ae/ I DK

347261	I dont believe they are for america, epsecially when they say make america great again. When they undo so many policies. They are against immigrants, that makes me dislike them. 
347406	they apperar disoprgsnized and do not have a plan and their top candidates are not fit for offiuce and i dagree with amny of their policies/ao/no 
347472	I feel they are encrouching in some of outr civil rights /ao/ I feel they use christianity as a mask for personal agendas /ao/ I feel that they favor protectingwealthy americans rather that protecting middle class and poor americans /ao/ I dont like that they support taking away a woman's reproductive rights /ao/ That's it 
347580	Their alliegance to Trump /AE/ No that's it 
347759	Its not the republican party that I grew up with/my grandfather was a delegate for years back in indiane for the GOP and I used to be for the GOP but I changed when I moved out here when they became so extreme/and also heavy christians/AO// 
347801	Everything. /AE/ No. 
348052	Sometimes they bicker too much amongst themselves, can't get anything done. /AE/ No I guess not. 
348423	I don't like it's ties to labeling themselves as Christian views. Not becasue I'm against Christian views but I don't think that they represent those views. There is also a lack of diversity and labeling all immigrants as criminal/ae/no 
348758	using our consrtitution as a leverage and they are argliates are more concerns about their pockets they do have a great marketing campaign to force working class to work harder/ao/ no 
348761	Also the immigrants./AE/The economy situation/AE/no 
348962	The oportunity to improve their positions in front of the low incomes people, AE NO 
349098	i do not like how it semms to have become an extreme covservative party that has taken us back in time almost; 
349275	Some of their immigration policy are lost and don't have the same view as them. 
349767	I feel like theres a lot of christian nationalism that has taken over the party and alot of americans do not hold those same values and should not be forced too. /ae/no 
349864	I don't like how the party has become Trumps. Its not the repbulican party anymore trump tells them what to do/Ao/I don't like how they do whatever or say ehatever and it doens't match what is really happening/Ao/ No 
350000	They are cutting taxes for the rich and to cut medicare and welfare, limited legal abortion in most of the country. 
350030	they support rump and their willing to lie and cheat to win and keep power ae/ thats enough 
350183	Sometimes they just don't have a set. They don't stick together./ae/no 
350302	They're too conservative, I don't like the followers of the republican party, they're all too cocky, they feel like everything they abide by is right and that only their system is right /AE/ No 
350327	Like I mentioned it's more of the policy around gun laws and around the foreign policies. /AO/ No 
350387	social issues 
350406	seemingly unwilling to hear the other side, 
350724	Everything 
350747	extreme views, / ae/ no listening / ae/ no 
350868	health care concerns/ I dont think the GOP cares as much as i want them to about health care/ae/climate issues sometimes dismisses climate issues/ae/ 
350980	they favor the rich, and give them tax breaks, don't pay their fair share/AE/no 
351238	Trickle down economics. Just their view on people. Their more aligned for the rich. 
351535	I feel their platform is largly based on hate and fear, I feel they have largely lost any shred of integrity, with very few exceptions. /ae/ I cannot trust the Republican Party. /ae/ No. 
351784	their lack of balance in their platforms, and th fact that they can promote a candidate like Donald Trump 
351859	A lot of theri opinions on things like abortion, immigration, general opinio towards people of color, women, gay people, trans people, how they handle taxes for the lower and middle class. /AE/ Off the top of my head no. 
352003	maybe their stance on women's rights/ae/nope 
352166	They don't want to listen. I don't like people who don't want to listen. /AO/ Just understand that everybody have an opinion besides just you. /AO/No 
352264	I dont who stands for the republican party, the leaders and what they say are trying to split us up, and how they are trying to tkae back womens rights, and the anger that comes with the party./ae/i dont like the message the party sends/ae/no 
352409	Trump and JD Vance. /AE/ All they stand for. That sums it up. /AE/ No. 
352423	At present I dislike everything. They're not the Republican party anymore. They have lost their direction. Nut jobs. A lot of good people who through dis-information have been misled entirely. /AE/ No 
352461	i dont like their inaction on abortion/ao/they have a very substandaard view on 2nd amendment they just want to impose more gun lasw on law abiding citizens and they dont go after the criminals they only empower them/ao/no

353983	dislike that a lot of thme just stick to Trump. haven;t done anything to balance the budget, coul be more middle of the road like abortion, handling the speaker of the house 
354122	I don't like how they've gotten more and more conservative, it feels like the average republicans at least the ones I know are less likely to have any liberal views, it being a thing of othering stuff. When I was younger I thought I was conservative but the more I read policies the stuff I thought was conservative was actually liberal. /AE/ No. 
354233	Not all what it seems to be, don't know whose lying or telling the truth, or who has the best interest of our country, both sides could be, rpeulbican party believes in the values that she has, why she's voting republican /AE/ No 
354361	They've gotten soft /AE/ No 
354499	republican party is try to do the opposite and we are the working class are paying for it. they are tyring to gert more money in their pockets and the are trying to make us pay for it/ao/no 
354560	While I agree with some of their policies I find the fact that they have sold out in order to support someone that I think is an unhealty individual in Donald Trump an absolutely repulsive reflection on the party /AE/ No 
354599	the candidate, the president, their voting for the welfare of the party an not bipartisian 
354834	I thinks its the exact oppsite of the democratic party and its hard for citizens to know what their stands are because they' re always changing , I feel their demographics and the people that they pander to are the middle age white men 
354914	Just about everything. They've been taken over by a conman who wants to be a dictator, and he has too many people, they could have stopped him but they did not. They're afraid of him. /AE/ Yeah I mean, they've done nothing, the house of representatives is being obstructive. /AE/ They're accepting far right lies, and many of them will not say that joe biden has won the election. /AE/ That's the best I can come up with. 
355008	Siento que son mas anti inmigrantes /ao/ No seria todo 
355272	They get to mud slingin too much sometimes instead of getting down to brass tacks./ae/no 
355323	They prefer profit over people/ae/no 
355622	Civil rights, inmigration, separation church state 
355942	More war oriented/ae/no 
355971	They're spending too much money, and again special interests like the democrats, it's all about etting elected and not necessarily doing the right thing for the country. /AE/ Yeah I don't like the way that they've treated trump. RINO, they've colluded with the democrats against him. Whereas the majority of republicans want him and his policies, I don't the split in the party. Everybody has the right to their opinion. It's divided a lot of people, my counsins are RINO's, republican in name only, have you heard of that term. /AE/ The thing is I don't like politicians, the stuff I say about them is the same as other politicians. The stuff I say about trump is because he's not a politician, the stuff he could say is he's a jerk but. /AE/ No, that's good. 
355994	Probably some conservative standpoints AE no 
356134	they have become a coult of personality, no longer a real counter balance of democratic policy. no longer providen value on devolping policy 
356222	They have taken all the athority away from the president on both sides AE 
356695	They make such a strong push for the economy and only the economy /AE/ Nothing else I can think of 
356884	they lack certain elements of social policies that I would like to see more of. This would include abortion policy as well as LGBT rights //ao// thats it 
356927	Most of their policies don't align with my beliefs. I feel like they care more for socioeconomic classes that are at levels I don't believe I'll ever achieve and that very few can achieve. /AE/ I also don't think that they care for or want to see the struggles that a lot of minority groups deal with. /AE/ I think the extreme Republicans, the far right Republicans make it so our country goes backwards in times with their policies. /AE/ That's all 
357011	They are a cult of Donald Trump. They call Donald Trump the chosen one...and how they all (most) kiss his ring. A/E Judgmental. They use the Christian faith as a tool to achieve power and hipocrosy. A/E No that is fine. 
357072	anti abortion/ae/lack of separation of church and state/ae/ strong ties to russia/ae/most people in the party today are awful. some are not./ae/ bad with the economomy/ae/the GOP is too okat with school shootings, lack of urgency to take care of children./ae/ 
357625	Yeah to quote walz, its just gotten weird. The republican party at this point, there is no platform other than supporting donald trump and what he says any day of the week. I feel the republican party of the past had goals and be bipartisan, that no longer exists. If this republican party had rights during the civil rights year, it would be a strongly different country. This version of the republican party has become so supportive of ultra christanity, of white men, that, as well as so against federal governement and state government that believes the same way thaey do, if they get in power again nothing will get acccomplished, eveyrthing of the past 100 years will get reversed, as one example roe v wade, that's just the tip of the iceberg. /AE/ That's the top ten, I'll stop there. 
357680	they are capitulate with all the ideas that DT wants. Without coming to conservative policies, they are the party taking away the way that right to choose. They are encouring people making the bad guys and blaming everything to any group that the pick. Instead that of coming policies that might fit issues. AO/no 
357747	The republican party doesn't seem to be able to get their heads out of their asses, they're not as well organized as the Democratic machine is. Case in point when they removed the speaker of the house on that lame vote, to oust him just because one person didn't like him caused harm to the republican power base and its effectiveness. Radical members of the republican party such as Getz, who didn't like the then speaker of the house and when that speaker decided to make a decision for the republicans, Getz decided to use the newly adopted where one person can call for a vote of no confidence and it had serious ramifications. They are not well organized to advance their agenda but they are also victim to the media and how the media has turned into Tass Pravda. /AE/ No. 
357891	Blatant refusal to acknowledge or accept core scientific principles, casual disregard for fact. Desire for power to super that supercedes all morality. Willingness to vote on the sideof the republican party regardless whether or not any such action that they are voting on is within the best interest of the country . Complete disorganiztion within the party as how to further the republican party goal. 
358037	Religion /ae/ no 
358067	many of them are Democrats and many of them say they are somewhat Nationalist or love this country but then support the same types of policies that Democrats also support that are undermining what I would consider to be what makes this nation great/ae/no 
358072	the do approve of abortio 
358094	Certainly in Missouri they as the Democrats are too far out this way, the Republicans are too far out this way. LIke for instance abortion, there are no options at any stage, I think as far out as Democrats are on one side the Republicans are too radical. 
358575	they currently feel pulled toward their extremes with radical approaches to personal freedoms including anti LGBTQ and anti abortion 
358578	They are stupid, they dont get anything done and they dont see what is happening and fix it/AE/no 
358730	They do not seem to have the best interests of their supporters; they only want to keep white CIS males in power; they want to suppress the rights and freedoms of others; they are the party of racism, xenophobia, and misgyny; didn't always seem to be that way but it is now very clear that what their agenda is and they favor the wealthy. /AO/ I forgot about something else I like about Kamala Harris and that's gun control. What I like about the Democratic Party; what I like about Kamala. /AO/ No. 
358765	Uhh, their views on Gun control, I stand with democrats on this one. I believe an assault weapons ban is good. I don't like their views on abortion. Umm, however I did appreciate Trump saying that he believes in exceptions this pass debate, however I believe that the future of the abortion issue is better handled by a democrat. I do not like their rhetoric and comments that have been made against people that are not from here, specifically Trump. And another umm, their comments against gay and lesbian people. And certain aspects of their economic proposals. Certainly those that have to do with government assiustance programs. /AO/ No 
358767	there not gettin their own act together they are becoming too splittered and when you splinter you dont get anything done/ao/they too need to stand behind what they feel needs to be done/ao/no 
358780	extremly right wing /ao/no 
358797	Overall it would be stances on gun rights, abortion and the separation of church and state /ae/ that is all 
359053	Their stance on aboortion, that one right there, you want to take away my rights from my body it's right up there with slavery /AE/ No 
359131	Trump, 
359188	I don't know I haven't nit-picked them like the Democratic party. I don't know, I'm sure there is but I can't recall anything right now. /AO/ No 
359197	They are not for the average working person, they only care about the rich AE 
359280	very conservative, taking away rt from women in particular 
359281	Lo de las armas /AE/ No 
359299	they dont govern. 
359322	It's all white old or wanna be white old men who are sociaopaths, don't care anything about the people and want to protect their own kind, fascists. 
359345	after the insurection, was one of the worse time that I live in ths country they didnt hold Donald Thrump acountable for that 
359361	they seem to be against the lower class and they like to give tax breaks to the wealthy in the country and that's about it /AE/ no 
359614	don't like the direction they are going in /ao/ no 
359646	I wish they would gve better people to vite for, better choisces, someone like Ron Reagon; soeone string but not obnoxious 
359760	The fighting against Democrats for just being Democrats. /AE/ No. 
359773	exstream conserverative//ao//no 
359839	That they have supported Donald Trump as their nominee, not once but twice, given how hateful and divisive he is /ae/ Yes I mean like due to his nomination it seems ti have escalated divisions in the US and racism, other acts of violence against people around the country /ae/ I'll leave it there for right now 
359848	tey are invested in making money wether its throughthe american people or foreign countries ae/ dont like their stance on abortion ae/thats it 
359882	They are not doing enough. A/E No 
359989	Just their person that's running for president basically and vice president /AE/ Can't think of anything right this minute. 
360129	It feels shameful that the Republicans have brought donal Trump as their candidate as I see him as a very immoral and unethical figure/ae/I don't see the party taking a human center approach on many of thier issues/ae/no 
360194	The source of dirty tricks/AE/ there cheap motivation seems to be their control of the populs or culture regardlesss of tactic they use./AE/ Their chief seems to be control, power./AE/ they have members who reflect a lack of formal education but loud mouths, it goes back to atleast the girl from Sarah Palin, marjorie green something, Boebarte from colorado changed her district, people like Desantis, trying to modify the school system and libraries. The republicans are interested in rewinding the clock the on women's rights. 
360536	They always look out for the big man, or the rich man /ae/ no 
360636	singler focus religion of being christians vs. accepting all of the religions / ae / over governing people's right and taken away people's freedowm / ae / the lies and the dis-honesty and argumentative behavior demostrated by congress of the formor president / ae / these action are in-powering regular citizens to be confidentional while listening to new and finding better ways for opionions / ae / pushing too hard to maitain right for wapons and others wapons that are mean for milatry use to be the hands of servarians and did not have the porper training on the dagous or the mental compacity require for that level of responsibility / ae / no 
360975	in general there against abortions and i feel thats part of womens rights/ao/they are strong affilication with NRA and i feel the NRA goes a little overboard/ao/no 
360976	they are against foreign women and minority and voting rights, , their immgration reform or lack of polocy, attack on public schools, attack on middle class while they bolsteringbthe 1 percent of the population ,Christian nationalism 
360982	everyrthing i would say that thwy seem to be more sconcern about the wealthy people of the country and that they have christian values biut do not expell them and prqctive them and those that are christians do not help them/ao/no 
361115	Better campaign to gather non white members, thats it 
361162	I do not like the fact that they can't work together, the two parties /ae/ well they're all... they're all living a lie about Donald Trump, yknow it's everybody is, not just... my kids are too, they're lost. I've got 4 kids, college educated kids that are completely lost as to what he's doing... I rasied em not to lie and to do the right thing, I don't /ae/ no

361702	none of them have go a backbone they dont stand up for what they believe in

362168	Some of the stuff, Trump has relaxed some of his stance on abortion AE 
362218	I dont care for there stand on immagration or for who they have nominated as president. In the pass I havent really like their approach to taxes. I dont like their stance on abortion rights. Im concerned about their pro business posture and how it effects working families/AO/ I alos don't like how they talk about women some of their spokes people are misogynist an rapist 
362604	I dont like how close minded it can be at times, especilaly, even thought I do agree with many of their policies, they don't have surfce level appeal to the average person to undestand their plicy, and the democtratic party does a better job at that; I lso dont like their education system plicies; 
362661	the R party doesn't ;have a full grasp the importance of education and has dropped the ball on promoting trades over a vacuous college degree. there needs to be some tough talk and decisions about gun laws, and government intrusion into agricultural enterprises, and this ties into what i don't like about the D party, we've got to stop looking at abortion as birth control which includes education. We need tougher laws in men, legally, when it comes to sexual assaults. And we need to look at women in the individual situations rather than a blanket law across the state with little variance. 
362679	Don't like hiprocries, stands on abortion, stands on Union, How they support a trader, how they elected a con man, don't like the lying. 
362840	They are so extreme

363438	anti immigration, anti abortion rights and anti LGBTQ rights/ae/ even worse on regulations like the FDA and EPA. they are moving to gut the powers of those regulatory agencies/ae/no 
363507	The way it has shifted from a politial idealism to a religious idealism. I just feel as though it has strayed away from politics. It no longer stands for what the republican party stands for. I also think there is a lot of hate/ae/no 
363630	I don't like the fact that they aren't coming together as a group on abortion. /AO/ No 
363670	i think everything they did was dishonesat and they gort away with too much/ao/no 
363801	I think their views are very old fashioned. I think they are way to often aligned with religion. I have rarely seen them do anything for the topics that I am most invested in being women's right, trans right, the rights of the LGBTQ community, and working toward eliminating and minimizing racism in the county. I believe the loudest representatives of their party in todays world are terrible representatives for their party specic examples Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. /AE/ I dont think so. 
363934	think they get too up in arms abt rt and wrong and have no gray area. dont see immigrants as people. take to harsh of stances on jail time 
364258	The rhinos. /ae/lack of stability./ae/nothing else 
364370	i dont thim they know hwo to handle anything/ao/no 
364677	thingk they are facious, religious totalitarians, they are trying to replace democracy. they are trying to destroy america. 
364684	a lot of the talking point for the republican party can come acroos as deciviscive or creating us versus them or inpocing onemoral view on everybody else 
365029	Donald Trump, they seem to bring the church in to goverment, they insentivice the weathy. 
365070	they tried to take women's right away / ae / no 
365110	Umm, I would say their take on like legalization on recreational drugs. Ummm probably their more favorable tax leniency toward the rich. /AO/ No 
365212	i dont like enforcing kids that are black in school , because theyre too young 
365449	I don't like the way the parties have been so divided, I don't know whose faul tthat is, its been 8 years of just craziness. Don't know whoese doing it, don't know which party but they're constantly at odds. At 9/11 when both sides, everyone was singing the national anthem on the steps, everybody was here together for the country, where has that been for 8 years? /AE/ Debates are my favorite /AE/ No 
365496	their continue to push miss information and false narrative to confirm their bios. they also said they are the party of small govertmnet and christina values but their actions dont match these stattements. 
365558	I feel they're a cult right now. I don't like the way they handle the nra and don't allow gun control to pass. I don't like the way the block things that will benefit the american people for their own political agenda /ae/ no 
365669	i dont like there stance on womens rights im not into it being too religion based, i dont think the democratic party uses religion to stance their ideas i dont think its fair in that/ao/no, 
365679	I dont think that they really care about their constituets. In fact I think the leaders in both parties are holding on to power and getting rich and keeping themselves rich. I think they are all committing felonys at the very least all of them but that one democrat with the tiktok are doing inside training. /ae/no that's all. 
365722	their stance on womans' healthcare 
365805	Well, similar to the democrats, blaming each other, you know the blame when theyre at the divots or on the tv commericals ote for me cause this person did this and is terrible I dont think someone should always be judged by their character. I don't think that should be chose because they did that like one time when they were teenagers and tried marijuana and did drugs or something. We were teenagers then, were adults now hopefully. I don't think they should be judged for what they did in the past, unless they killed someone or something like that. /AE/ The only thing I'd say for the both of them is wether they;re truthful. I know they'll say they'll do something and congress with veto it, so it's not really their fauly because congress will say e'll veto it so yeah. /AE/ I don't know. 
365943	They have a bunch of grumpy old white males /AE/ Mitch Mcconell needs to go to hell /AE/ No 
366126	que somos diferentes 
366256	The state-level abortion ban, local school board politicking./AE. No. 
366281	I think there's a lot of the Republican party that's fallen to the dark side also. That's all. 
366332	Not very concerned with individuals success and well being. 
366544	They are racist and they care too much for the money. They're more about that one percent. 
366836	Their fanaticism and that it's turned into an extremist party a very christian nationalist extremist party and it didn't used to be like that um and that it heavily protects more so than it ever did the mega rich um so yeah /AE/ That's pretty much it.

367650	Conservatism /AO/ No 
367771	I feel as though the Republican party leans more conservative rides on the backbone of religion and they're not as supportive of people's freedom to choose what they want with their bodies. And that could be from the aspect of medical care and the aspect of their gender of their bodies. 
368013	they are not totally united /ao/ no 
368057	Their bond to religion. The acceptance of going low and being mean. How they are allowing Trump to be king.

369794	I fele they aren't doing anything for the american people anymore. /AE/ I think that's it. 
370232	the main point of what I dont like, their stance on healthcare, their support of Donald Trumo; it feels very divisive, they dont work bipoartisan, they dont' respocet other views;

371499	If were talking about Trump he's good at talking about economics getting back on track with oil and gas hes good at that but as far as policies go outside the United States he does not have a clue. He just bad mouths people. One thing thats in my craw about veterans he said they are a bunch of looser. He just back tracks. 
371601	The values have changed over the last two decades over what they stand for. 
371716	They do not put the peple first, it' their status and money and 15 min of fame /ao/ no 
371794	Currently, they are liars today. For some reason they think their opinions are facts; they have no respect for people if you don't think them they are disagreeable, their oath means nothing to them./AE/They do not embrace humanity, if you don't embrace it you are the contrarian; they are only about their political position and power; like when you deprive Obama the opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court nominee./AE/When you can't do your job and convict Donald Trump on 2 different occassions where he's been idicted by the House, with all the evidence that was highlighted. At this point they are embracing the 34 counts of a convicted felon as a Presidential Candidate. How does that demonstrate your patriotism?/AE/Overall they failed to look out for the best interests for constituents and Americans generally. /AE/No. 
371799	Donald Trump. A/E I would like to say something a little stronger than that...even if Donald Trump was gone...too much religion. A/E That's it 
371822	Theres a lot. Thats all I have to say. 
371875	they dont agree on some things that they should

372998	That there is more attention toward the wealthier people inthe country; the upper class and less attention to the middle and lower class people of the country; /ao/no. 
373244	some of the stuff Trump says, a little concerning, wild and crazy. You always have a crazy uncle in the family but you still love them, he has a good heart. I don't like the two party system. So divisive. 
373259	Republican, which i was once a member, has giben up on balancing the budget, they no longer fiscally conservative, openly racist, opencly anti-immigrant, all their policies are only good for corporations and the wealthy, they have been completely captured by DT, they are heartless and uncaring about average people, they refuse to convict DT on his 2 impeachments, many of them supported the insurrection, and the whitewashing that's occurred afterwards, they are anti trans, and anti -LGQ+, DT as a candidate hasn't announced a single policy that would benefit normal americans, his policies are revenge for himself and tx cuts for the rich, Rep party wastes time on nonsense cultural wars instead of things that would actually benefit the american peiople, practically everything else they do is wrongheaded and in many cases evil, Rep governers have refused funds for school lunches, they are also woking to take away a womans right to choose, they refuse to stand for IVF, they're incessant spinning of bad and evil deeds by members of their party like DT, 
373349	they have distain for minorities, take away women's rights and health choices/AE/no 
373353	I guess the deal with the border crossing or however you want to say it, like it's ok for some to come but not ok for others, I just don't feel something is not right about that, it's like a pick and choose situation, if you can let some then you should let all, I think people that are at war with their country I think we should reach out to help in any way we can /AE/ no 
373501	that they dont compromise either 
373611	just about everything. 
373614	A little cohorted. /AE/ Not really. 
373727	they are not quite as accepting of people /ae/ they are not supportive of helping ppl financially as much/ae/ no 
373749	i don't like that they don't believe in global warming, think that women are worth anything. JD Vane basically thinks that I should be watching my grandchildren. Grandparent should be watching the grandchildren that's why theyre here. They never say their wrong. 
373800	They don't do enough. They don't fight back hard enough. I mean their policies/ae/no 
373845	tey become partisan they protext one side, same with both parties, instead of solving the problem they try to point balme at each other, this is both sides ae/ should be it 
373980	They are not that smart / they lack emotional intelligence / ae / no 
374163	They tend to fall into establishment politics. That candidates that are outside of that establishment are attacked or they feel threatened by them before there is even a record of policy to judge them by. /AE/ No 
374370	Historiclaly this goes back a little bit, when the Republican party was moral they were great, it was a one on one, you were wither R or D based on the views, then the tea party game along, the radical right, which the R party welcomed them with open arms. When that happened the R party became much more to the right and that screwed the Republican party, never minded them before that, very conservative, somtimes he is too, when the drop the convervatistm and went to extremes in policies that they wanted to adopt it sowered him on the belief in the Republican party. Then comes along a candidate like Ted Cruz, the extreme right, not a centrist R but leaning far Right, then Trump, even father right, then JD Vance even further right. Those directions are huting the Republican party. /AE/ There's a lot of people that he talks to, Republicans, who are buying into this far right crap, don't recognize that the tea party when it came about and was assylimated into the regular R party, they don't see that that was the cause of the problem, going right along with their guys sayings its terrible. Republicans are not saying this isn't centrist, not what we beileved in, no longer conservatism but convservatism to the extreme /AE/ No 
374556	I dont like the way In which religion seems to Impact policy, and that they dont see a social responsibility in supporting underpriveleged populations. their immigration Policy seems rooted in racism and there seems to be Blind support of donald trump/ae/nope 
374629	white Causain men in politics, favoring the wealthy over the middle class and poor, Roe vs Wade being reversed, stacking of the SUpreme Court,

375143	everything /ms/ I don't like what they stand for, I don't like the crooked ways they do things, I dont like the... like I said they're putting small businesses out, out of businesse, they want corporations. Small businesse is the backbone of the United States and they want to kill it... I don't like nothin about them /ae/ just everything 
375310	i perceibe as the party of no, afraid of change, white supremacy party, old people, stuck in the past, not doing anything to help the country, oppose to changes. all they do is say no, afraid of change, maybe negative, 
375394	I just feel the Republican party is trying to pull the country apart/ae/no 
375448	Can't get together to do anyhting /AE/ No

376557	i think thta theyre right ward shift is very disturbing to me as a former reublican, when i was active they pretty much middle in the road and now they have shifted and i diagree with that. They were always for personal freedoms, theyve become reactionary, they were progressive compared to democrats in the 1960's. I first started paying attention in college at [REDACTED], and at that time the repubican party was quite progressive as well democratic under kennedy, america was moving very rapidly in good directiom, but republicans have turned right and gone back. Become xenophoic, miopic in terms of programs, favor the wealthy and not the people a large, turned on personal freedoms such as the women's right t choose. we can see the shift in the way supreme court is handling the cases before them. this would not have happened without the support of mega wealthy, using money to appeal to the court. ao/ no

377993	Well I don't know how much is true. They have the whole 2025 initialltve. It's in the back in my head , is it something they want to push foward. It sounds awful. Like laura bowbert and Marjorie taylor green, it's not good. I was just reading a book recently in my bible group and it was bok about her faith and it she was an NBC anchor and people questioned if she can be a Decocrat and Christian. 
378378	Too much business oriented. I don't like their tax plans. I don't like their position on the environment. Don't like thier position on abortion. /AE/ That's good for now. 
378549	They really don't care about the people at the bottom//ao/ that's it 
378683	I think that they cater to the wealthy /ao/ that sums it up 
378893	the fact that they're willing to fill their hand just like the dems in congress, on the take so to speak. AE no 
378977	What I don't like them is that I don't think they believe in equality especially when it comes to immigrants, I'm not an immigrant but I'm a people's person /AE/ No 
378992	they control the prices when Democrats get into office they raise prices up to make them look bad /AE/ that's it 
379055	they are tring to ban abortion / ae/ they are the reason of the IVF has become a target laterly / ae / they seem to be less interesting in working with the by pass the regristlation / ae /no 
379149	Want to cut out benefits for elder people. 
379202	They've been bewitched. They have lost thier minds. The have sold out/ae/They have no morale compass/ae/no 
379384	I don't like the fact that they don't stick together and they are too polite when it comes to political matters/ae/no 
379495	main point s the place of religion with in governance/the belief in moral absolutes/i disagree with them on the refrugee and immagration population/the consequesces of american hostoru and foreigmn affaors/i disacgree aon the economy i disagree on the views on public school and environment/ao/no 
379936	they seem to back big businesses over middle and lower income/ae/ no, just it seems our local officials seem to butt heads with them alot in our community/ae/ no

380885	women's right reproductive right / ae / tax policy favor to the rich / ae / no 
381027	I think that there are a lot of extremists/ae/and how they handle....the conservative right. How conservative they are/ae/no 
381267	Politics /AE/ No 
381281	I guess I don't trust any political party to be honest with you, I can't think of anything to be honest with you, I don't have total trust in them, I vote for the candidate and not the party /AE/ no 
381286	obstructionists /ae/ (a Marjory Taylor Green thing just jumoed into my head and R laughed) personality lead /ae/ the members /ae/ the chairmen /ae/ no 
381341	complete approval of the Trump , the 3 senators that put him off and he became the cult, ae... 
381884	Not doing what they say, 
381908	don't like sometimes they promse and don't keep the promse ae/ foreign policy ae/ tariff policy ae/ thts it 
382062	THE ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE ISSUE/AO/NO 
382410	In Senate they didn't allow Obama to appoint Supreme Court Justice; despite there being a vacancy; now it's 6-3 it could have been 5-4; There were eleven/eleven and half months; there was a little less than one year; then they came up with a fictious reason that less than one year; can't allow him to appoint a Supreme Court Justice; that was Mitch McConnell. Trump was able to appoint three justices. /AO/ That's it. The policies the Republicans have been following when they are in majority they are against all what America used to stand for. /AO/ That's it; everything else we do know the differenec between Democrats and Republicans, especially when it comes to law and order; they are also doing the same thing that Democrats are doing; another thing now when Republicans come into power they will cut taxes for the rich they don't care about deficit; when democrats are in power they weill tallk about deficit; they want cut programs for the masses like social security and medicare. /AO/ That's it. See America is the only rich country in the world that does not have universal health care despite being the richest country in the world. Per capita income is about 65,000 or so, the highest in the world. Not including those countries like Kuwait that are oil rich and have small populations; U.S. has highest per capita income and we don't provide universal healthcare. /AO/ That sums it up, that's the one basic thing. 
382412	theyre more focused on financial achievement than on compassion; 
382868	 I feel like the abortion should be up to the individual//ao I'm sure it is, I just can't think of anything else 
383086	they're a threat to democracy, not working to greater good. Rep in congress not willing to work across aisle. they theatening 
383155	Yes, let's see. I think they're unwilling to compromise, yeah that's my biggest issue. /AE/ That's my big issue yes. 
383276	they get caught up in politics ad tey have a tendacy to become cowatds whn it comes to them standing their ground and reb like democats in dealing with the debt ceiling keep kiking the can own the road instead of standing courgeoulin and sayin this is where the buck stops ad basically they both rep and dems end up selling the county out/ao/no 
383295	thye tend to have a lot more people that want to just make the cash instead of looking after the people. /ae/ no 
383424	I don't like they like to help the rich more, give the rich more tax cuts, making them put their fair share in, they stick together even when they know the others are lying, rather than vote on the truth of a matter they stick together, they are taking away some of the values of being in America /AE/ that's it

383818	all of it/ao/no 
383828	Focuses on Trump so focus on the border with misstatements, focus on crime with misstatements or lies, some of those things are bad but their redicilous stuff, mistatements on the economy, the selection of JD Vance, project 2025 /AE/ the whole notion of woke, banning books its like were afraid of learning what actually occured as opposed to the polite stories we were all told growing up /AE/ No 
383921	seems like they don't do much when they can, when they have the majority

385243	their extreme views on women ppotitians and women in general; 
385696	Their lack of, how do I say this, their lack of not doing what's favorable for the american people. /ae/ no, that's it. 
386140	capiatalism, theyre more like based off that, frame of mind. Like all ritzy people and sometimes that get its like a flip, the capitalism part of the Rs is strong and i think it can be destructive when there's too much of it, big business monopolies, like 2% of the rich, there's no middle class anymore, now its like lower class your either wealthy or super poor. 
386678	Donald Trump. /AE/ No

388827	they create division because they stay on code. sometimes if something is not right you need to speak out against it and not just continue to move because the crowd is moving sometimes you need to go in anothe direction and that alwys doenst happen currently the republican adminstration have becom clowns the party that was supposed to be abou tthe country probably divded th ecounty more than other party in the past thinking 30 years ago we woul dof moved further now and be together more a lot of division in the past 6 years the republicn party had a hand control media big share of money in the county .

388996	that their whole attack style lack of vision unethical behaviors and just nmot staying on point not looking at the country and how they can make it better but hopw worse threy are making it/ao/no 
389028	I don't like their overall uh the frowned upon nature of medical marijuana and things like that /AE/ I guess their look on the way that they treat cannabis, their views on cannabis, I'm not saying that's all of them, but usually that's things you here Democrats advocating for /AE/ no 
389211	old died in the wool republicans that loves carees in politics//ao// that's about it, sums it up 
389371	the party itself 
389434	The fact that most if not all of the leaders in the Repubiclian party are sicyophantic spinless, trump aleged folowers because they are afraid of him, lost what little respect for Republicans had in politics /AE/ No 
389759	The fact that they all seem to be on the same page and no one has a backbone to stand up to the fascist they're trying to put in office. America doesn't seem to be their primary objective ,power seems to be their primary objective /ae no 
389789	i don't feel they stand up for themselves 
389940	they are in general terms exstreamly right wing, they are funded by these right wing , I don't agree with their plans if trump is elected, I thing they are corupted in general terms//ao// that probably sums it 
389969	The negative campaign of Trump and Vance. 
389971	They don't have the ability to reach accross the aisle and compromise on anything. They're up there to work for us not a party, and they argue. /AE/ No, that's my biggest qualm. 
390206	Sometimes I think they can be too extremist. 
390407	It isn't that I dont like it, I don't fully understand it. The 2025 project, and the democrats are making a big deal over it, and i've done some research and I think the democrats are lying about it, but that's the only thing I need to do some research on and get some ideas on it. But the democrats have this crazy project that I hate, this 19 something, whatever it is. So I guess everybody has something. /AE/ Nope, that's the only thing that's really of question, still doing my research on it. 
390479	I feel the Republican party has realigned itself around Donald Trump as a figure head, and I think as a party, they no longer care about following the will of the American people. I think they've become extremists, and I think they've begun promoting authoritarian ideology, because the policies they want to advance are so extreme, they know that the people won't suppor them. /ae/ I think the party is intentionally spreading disinformation and misinformation, and I think they've become a party that's really focused on grievances and pitting people against each other. /ae/ I think they are actively trying to end democracy in this country--Not true of every Republican, but the people who are in charge of the party are actively trying to end democracy. /ae/ No. 
390574	charcteristically too old school ae/ thats it 
390645	I think they can do a better job of taking care of the national debt, I think everyone's gotta pitch in on that, we've gotta stop spending somehow /AE/ No 
391287	Stance on abortion/ae/no 
391578	right now I hate that the REP party leaders arent doing any education for those following them; not standing up to the crowd; this bothers me alot; this nens there may be a POWErFUl leader; not combatting the powerful forces within their group instead of standing up fpr beliefs, panic about looseing the vote, and they dont talk in a rationcal civil wy; attack, attack, attack insteadof working things out; vilifying and diefying; when you are a leader you teach people, you dont follow the corwd 
391919	Appointed leadership could be better for president. /AE/ No. 
391970	Que odian a Mexico /ao/ Que no reconocen lo que las cosas buenas que hacemos para el pais los hispanos /ao/ Nada mas 
391981	I don't like their birth control stuff. /AE/ No. 
392069	I think the Republican party has consistently had policies that negatively affect working class people, this party tends to be more likely to engage in military action, which I see as a negative thing, the Republican party is traditionally socially conservative, which I also don't agree with. /ao/no 
392078	all of their views/ao/no 
392354	they dont seem to be willing to work across the aisle taht would actually benefit peeps. there seems to be a trend to follow an ultra conservative agenda /ae/ no 
392373	That would be RINOs, sometimes they are too harsh, hard core on some issues. A/E 
392584	i don't like the fact when something is presented to the people of the US there is always things hidden in the things that are trying to get passed. When they present one thing and put in other things are added. its frustrating to have to make the concessions to get the things that would be beneficial passed and the so many other things that are presented to the people there are so many things that are hidden in bills, never presented to the masses 
392587	Donald Trump /ao/ no 
392811	Yes, I'm sure there are. I just can't think of any right now. /AO/No 
392941	Sometimes I feel that there is too much talk and not enough action in Congress/ae/no 
393194	I think they ...I dont like the extremism, like where soe of those religious things I believe in, I think the repulicans just coming in and changing Roe v Wade soft of making that a religions stance; I appreciaite their adherance to the 2nd amendment but I think there needs to be more gun regulations, and i think thats the bog thinkg with the republicans who won't say ell I think we should have ak 47s i think they avoid the clippery slope 
393245	when they dont cooperate with other party because they are adhering to strict party lines/ae/their stand on abortion/ae/no 
393357	they arent doing their job, spending too much time pushing agenda instead of following people who voted for them. AE no 
393531	Is a cult dictatorship, they follow Donal Trump who is out for him self. they dont work together, and cannot work together, they are being control, the old party is not there something happen, much blame goes to Trump. 
393753	Both arties run each other down all the time./ae/There abortion policy. 
393820	more focus on supporting the weathy,againt abortion rights, dont seem willing to support the individual in the country as a whole.

394483	That focus on personal freedoms appears to encroach on the nature and health of other individuals /AE/ No 
394739	The extreme right of the party is more concerned with a principle than results. I think there are two individually motivated for their own wealth as opposed to the good of the country. 
394872	the way the have been let to represent are try to impower Trump; they are not strong enough to stand up for their lack of value / ae / i feel like they are send to Trump to keep the jobs / ae/ i use to feel that we have two party system in the country and the balance is a good thing, no the extreme created in the country is unresponsible / ae/ no

395173	i feel like their goals are off base and way out of touch with twht the american people need . they focused on celebrities/ao/no 
395180	I don't like the way all the Republicans suck up to Trump like he's god himself, they act like they're afraid of him. I have never in the history of this country have I ever seen a party where the leaders would call on their ex presidnet for advice and whatever else. He's running things on the Republican side in the white house right now just like he's in there, and he ain't got no dog in the race, or he don't suppoesd to have /ae/ no 
395396	imconfused wjy they continue keeping donald trump as theor caniate. i gre up in a split party home and even they dont like whats happenong. i feel everyone should have their own blief and it is scary when he speakjs 
395598	disregard for the environment, AO/no 
395658	The fact that they have been almost like cult-like, MAGA cult because of Trump. /AO/ It doesn't seem like they are thinking. Anything that Trump says they put it out in the news just like that, it doesn't seem like independent thought, it's more like a cult. /AO/ They seem to be taking away too many benefits from the middle-class and increasing the tax rates for the middle class and poor. /AO/ no. 
395742	I feel like they are tryning to regress any progress we made as a country and appear as self serving. A/E

395904	I generally do not align with their socioeconomic beliefs. /AE/ I feel there is a level of detachment within the republican party and maybe a loss of moral practices/beliefs. /AE/ No 
395998	they do like the dems. they double talk and lie/ae/ they ignorant on the sujects they talk/ae/ global warming and the abortion and Israel and they should be backing them 100% 
396012	They only think about the high class people insted of helping out the poor ones./ao/no 
396139	The abortion rights they believe in along with the immigration rights. 
396227	They seem to me to be more strict when it comes to social policies in the realm of religion, quality for gay and lesbian, immigrants.... /ae/no 
396256	I think I have tried to say already that I don't like that they don't always stand up for what they supposedly believe. they dont stick together. Democrates always vote in a block and republicans squabble and become ineffective like that. /ae/no 
396258	they literally just go off of what they hear, don't do reseaerch beyond fox news or donapld trump, think they know whats right for everyone, waive around god like they are religious butthey are not ae/ hipocritical ae/ thats it 
396470	their social Policy against immigration, womens rights. funding for infrastruction and education/ae/no

397505	How it's my way or no way. /AE/ That does it right there. 
398214	not taking a firm stand/ao 
398518	their current use of scare tactics, their lack of civility in their work place, congress. when I grew up the republican did not win a medal for the poeple and completely grew out of it., the fact that they wan to integrate religion into the goverment is a big thing. if they want to turn into a cristian nation thats a big problem, they want to tell people how to live their lives. Scary and wrong trying to intergrate religion into goverment is a bad thing, this country was found in separation of church and state. 
399579	Everything that they are doing and that they stand for and they are backing Trump they should not have done that. 
399815	my main issue is theur candidate, DT. And the fact they were able to support him after Jan 6th, and his taking documents, and he's a felon. They are not willing to work with the democratic party. You have to make concessions to keep the government running. 
399841	almost every thing, how they view minorities, indeceny, not as pro religions as the should be, not atruisted welcoming and encompassing, dont grsp psotions of young people, vwy pro 2nd amendment and nra, ant lgbt, xenophobic, view on policig, targeting of marginalized communities, ignorance partysw, xhibited biases, overall htefulness ae thats abou tt t
