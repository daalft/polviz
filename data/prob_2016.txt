healthcare,security//
Income disparity; well, all of the gains that have been made in the last eight years have gone to (well, the last 16 years) have gone to the extremely wealthy; the top 1%. Most others have gotten very little out of it. I think th election showed people blamed everything on President Obama and secretary Clinton; when in fact, I think the problems ...the tax code businesses going overseas, and automation. I think has been what has really happened. So there is less need for people with specialized education or skills. The campaign didn't do anything to address any of these problems. I think we're not looking at reality.

We've lost our moral direction.  Our media has a lot of stuff that encourages inappropriate sex, vulgar language. We've lost our kindness, I think. People are focusing so much on themselves.

Unization, we need to unite this country
Political division - I think that the country has always had polarization, but as it becomes more dramatic we become more aligned on how decisions are made, there's both a paraliyzing quality  to that and it produces a lack of civic unity that puts us at a disadvantage//
economic equality problem with elite stronger elite that has power to foward their interest at the expense of a poor base//

I think one of the most important problems in this country is climate change. This is even more important now because if we do not do anything to stop climate change the world as we know it is no longer going to exist. This is extra important now that our newly elected president does not believe in climate change. This is important because those that do not notice the loss of nature will not do anything to stop its demise.

IGNORANCE - There is a culture of people in the US taking pride in their willful ignorance. Reality shows are much better than thinking - thinking is hard. Aside from that, most people who profess to be Christians are anything but.  Most Christians are actually followers of Paul, who held everyone up to an impossible measure of righteousness. They do not follow Jesus, who said to love our neighbor and find the thief who stole your blanket and give him your coat as well.
